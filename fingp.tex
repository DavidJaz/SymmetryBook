\newcommand{\gporder}{cardinality\xspace}
\newcommand{\gporders}{cardinalities\xspace}
Objects having only a finite number of symmetries can be analyzed through counting arguments.  The strength of this approach is stunning.  The orbit-stabilizer theorem \cref{sec:orbit-stabilizer-theorem} is at the basis of this analysis: if $G$ is a group and $X:BG\to\Set$ is a $G$-set, then
$$X(\pt_G)\simeq \coprod_{x:X/G}\mathcal O_x$$
and each orbit set $\mathcal O_x$ is equivalent to the cokernel of the inclusion $G_x\subseteq G$ of the stabilizer subgroup of $x$.
Consequently, if $X(\pt_G)$ is a finite set, then its cardinality is the sum of the cardinality of these cokernels.  If also the set $\pt_G=\pt_G$ is finite much more can be said and simple arithmetical considerations put severe restrictions.  

Lagrange's \cref{thm:lagrange} gives the first example; if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ the cardinality ``$|G|$'' of $\pt_G=\pt_G$ is divisible by $|H|$, putting severe restrictions on the possible subgroups.  For instance, if $|G|=17$ (the arbitrary prime number), then $G$ has no notrivial proper subgroups! (actually, there necessarily exist identifications between $G$ and the cyclic subgroup of order $17$).  To prove this result we interpret $G$ as an $H$-set.


In order to get further we consider the $G$-set $\typesubgroup_G$ of subgroups of $G$.  This $G$-set is of vital importance for many applications and Sylow's theorems give the first restriction on what subgroups are possible and how they can interact.  The first step is Cauchy's \cref{thm:cauchy} which says that if $|G|$ is divisible by $17$, then $G$ contains a cyclic subgroup of order $17$.  Sylow's theorem goes further, analyzing subgroups that have cardinality powers of $17$, culminating in very detailed and useful information about the structure of the subgroup with the maximal possible power of $17$.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:finitegrd}Let $n:\NN$ be positive.  
A \emph{finite group of \gporder $n$}\index{finite group! of \gporder $n$} is a group $G$ such that the set $\pt_G=\pt_G$ is in $\fin_n$. 
A \emph{finite group}\index{finite group} is a group such that $\pt_G=\pt_G$ is a finite set. 
\end{definition}
So, the trivial group has \gporder $1$, the cyclic group $C_n$ of order $n$ has \gporder $n$ (which is good) and the permutation group $\Sigma_n$ has \gporder $n!$.

In the literature, ``order'' and ``cardinality'' are used interchangeabley for groups.


For finite groups, Lagrange's \cref{thm:lagrange} takes on the form of a counting argument
\begin{lemma}[Lagrange's theorem: counting version]
  \label{lem:Lagrangeascounting}
  Let $i:\Hom(H,G)$ be a subgroup of a finite group $G$.  Then $|G|=|G/H|\cdot|H|$.

If $|H|=|G|$, then $H=G$ (as subgroups of $G$).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Consider the $H$ action of $H$ on $G$, \ie the $H$-set $i^*G:BH\to\Set$ with $i^*G(x)\defequi(\pt_G=Bi(x))$, so that $G/H$ is just another name for the orbits $i^*G/H\defequi \sum_{x:BH}i^*G(x)$.  Note that composing with the structure identity $p_i:\pt_G=Bi(\pt_H)$ gives an equivalence $i^*G(\pt_H)\equiv (\pt_G=\pt_G)$, so that $|i^*G(\pt_H)|= |G|$.

  Lagrange's \cref{thm:lagrange} says that $i^*G$ is a free $H$-set \footnote{\cref{thm:lagrange} doesn't say this at present: fix it} and so all orbits $\mathcal O_x$ are equivalent to the $H$-set $\tilde H(x)=(\pt_H=x$).
Consequently, the equivalence 
$$i^*G(\pt_H)\simeq\sum_{x:i^*G/H}\mathcal O_x$$ 
of \cref{sec:orbit-stabilizer-theorem} gives that $G/H$ and $H$ are finite and that $|G|=|G/H|\cdot|H|$.\footnote{somewhere: prove that if $A$ is a finite set and $B(a)$ is a family of finite sets indexed over $a:A$, then $\sum_{a:A}B(a)$ is a finite set of cardinality $\sum_{i:\bn n}|B(f(i))|$ for any $f:\bn n=A$, hence if $m=|B(a)|$ for all $a$ then $|\sum_AB(a)|=n\cdot m$.}


Finally, since we are considering a subgroup, the preimage $Bi^{-1}(\pt)$ is equivalent to the set $G/H$.  If $|H|=|G|$, then $|G/H|=1$ and so the set $G/H$ is contractible.\end{proof}


    \begin{corollary}
      \label{cor:cyclicgroupsaresimple}
      If $p$ is a prime, then  the cyclic group $C_p$ has no non-trivial proper subgroups.
    \end{corollary}
    \begin{proof}
      By Lagrange's counting \cref{lem:Lagrangeascounting} a subgroup of $C_p$ has \gporder dividing $p=|C_p|$, \ie either $1$ or $p$.
    \end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:whatSylow2needs}Let $f:\Hom(G,G')$ be a surjective homomorphism with kernel $N$ and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$.  If $H$ and $G'$ are finite with coprime cardinalities, then $H$ is a subgroup of $N$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Let $i:\Hom(H,G)$ be the inclusion.  By \cref{lem:whatSylow2needs} the intersection $N\cap H$ is the kernel of the composite $fi:\Hom(H,G')$.  Let $H'$ be the image of $fi$. Now, Lagrange's counting \cref{lem:Lagrangeascounting} gives that $|H|=|H'|\cdot |N\cap H|$ and $|G'|=|G'/H'|\cdot|H'|$.  This means that $|H'|$ divides both $|H|$ and $|G'|$, but since these numbers are coprime we must have that $|H'|=1$, and finally that $|H|=|N\cap H|$.  This imples that $N\cap H=H$, or in other words, that $H$ is a subgroup of $N$ ((elaborate)).
\end{proof}


\section{Cauchy's theorem}
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:fixedptsize}
  Let $p$ be a prime and $G$ a group of \gporder $p^n$ for some positive $n:\NN$.  If $X:BG\to\Set$ is a non-empty finite $G$-set such that the cardinality of $X(\pt_G)$ is divisible by $p$, then the cardinality of the set of fixed points $X^G\defequi\prod_{z:BG}X(z)$ is divisible by $p$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Recall that the evaluation at $\pt_G$ gives an injection of sets $X^G\to X(\pt_G)$ through which we identify $X^G$ with the subset ``$X(\pt_G)^G$'' of all trivial orbits of $X(\pt_G)$.
 The orbits of $X(\pt_G)$\footnote{or of $X$?  Reference for identification of orbits with quotiens by stabilizers} all have cardinalities that divide the \gporder $p^n$ of $G$.  
This means that all the the cardinalities of the non-trivial orbits (as well as of $X(\pt_G)$) are positive integers divisible by $p$. 

 Burnside's Lemma \cref{lem:burnsides-lemma} states that $X(\pt_G)$ is the sum of its orbits.
Hence the cardinality of the set of all trivial orbits, \ie of $X^G$, is the difference of two numbers both divisible by $p$.  
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:cauchys}
  Let $p$ be a prime and let $G$ be a finite group of \gporder divisible by $p$.  
Then $G$ has a subgroup which is cyclic of \gporder $p$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\footnote{NOTE: three variants follow.  Have to choose one.  The middle needs some background essentially boiling down to $BC_n$ being the truncation of the $n$th Moore space.}
Recall the cyclic group $C_p$ of \gporder $p$ given by the pointed connected groupoid
$$BC_p\defequi(\sum_{S:\Set}\sum_{j:S=S}||(S,j)=\zet/p||,(\zet/p,!)),
$$
 where $\zet/p:\sum_{S:\Set}S=S$ was a particular model of a set with $p$ element together with a successor modulo $p$.  Informally, $BC_p$ consists of pairs $(S,j)$, where $S$ is a set of cardinality $p$ and $j:S=S$ is a cyclic permutation in the sense that for $0<k<p$ we have that $j^k$ is not $\refl{}$ while $j^p=\refl{}$.  Note also that $j^?:\bn p\to ((S,j)=(S,j))$ given by $j^?(k)=j^k$ is an equivalence (just as for the integers, a symmetry of $(S,j)$, \ie an $f:S=S$ so that $fj=jf$, must be $j^k$ for some $k:\bn p$, and if $k\neq l$, then $j^k\neq j^l$)

If $(S,j):BC_p$ let 
$$A(S,j)\defequi ((S,j)=(S,j)\to (\pt_G=\pt_G)).$$  Since we have an equivalence $j^?:\bn p\to ((S,j)=(S,j))$ we get that $J:A(S,j)\to \prod_{\bn p}(\pt_G=\pt_G)$ given by $J(g)=(g_{j^0},g_{j_1},\dots,g_{j^{p-1}})$ is an equivalence.  Define $\mu:\prod_{(S,j):BC_p}(A(S,j)\to(\pt_G=\pt_G))$ by $\mu_{(S,j)}(g)\defequi g_{j^0}\cdot\dots\cdot g_{j^{p-1}}$ and let $X:BC_p\to\Set$ be the $G$-set defined by  
$$X(S,j)\defequi\sum_{g:A(S,j)}\mu_{(S,j)}g=e_G.$$ 
The map from $X(S,j)$ to the $p-1$-fold product of $(\pt_G=\pt_G)$ with itself sending $(g,!)$ to $(g_{j^1},\dots,g_{j^{p-1}})$ is an equivalence ($\mu_{(S,j)}g=e_G$ says exactly that $g_{j^0}$ can be reconstructed as $(g_{j^1}\cdot\dots\cdot g_{j^{p-1}})^{-1}$), so $X(S,j)$ is a set of cardinality $p-1$ times the \gporder of $G$.  In particular, $p$ divides the \gporder of $X(S,j)$.

Specializing to $(S,j)$ being $\zet/p$ and allowing to index the elements in $A(\zet/p)$ with $i:\bn p$ (instead of the very awkward ``$(\sqrt[p]\id)^i$'' as purism would dictate) we proceed as follows.

Now, a $C_p$-fixed point of $X(\zet/p)$ is an element $(g_0,\dots,g_{p-1},!)$ such that $(g_0,\dots,g_{p-1},!)=(g_1,\dots,g_{p-1},g_0,!)$, \ie $g_0=g_1=g_2=\dots=g_{p-1}$\footnote{if I am allowed to write that}.  In other words, a fixed point is of the form $(g,\dots,g,!)$, where $!$ expresses that $g^p=e_G$:
$X(\zet/p)^{C_p}$ is equivalent to $\sum_{g:\pt_G=\pt_G}g^p=e_G.$  If we can show that $(g,!):X(\zet/p)^{C_p}$ is nonempty, we'd have established an abstract cyclic subgroup consisting of the powers of $g$.  Of course, setting $g=e_G$ will give us such a fixed point, but if $g\neq e_G$ we get a cyclic subgroup of \gporder $p$ of $G$.

 Now, \cref{lem:fixedptsize} claims that $p$ divides the cardinality of $X(\zet/p)^{C_p}$, and since there \emph{are} fixed points, there must be at lest $p$ fixed points.  One of them is the trivial one (given by $g=e_G$ above), but the others are nontrivial.

% $X(\zet/p)$ splits as a disjoint union of its orbits.\footnote{the formulation here depends on things to come: how do we express the decomposition into orbits?}  Since $p$ is prime, the group $C_p$ is simple ((where proved?)), and so the orbits are either singletons (fixed points) or free orbits:
% $$X(\zet/p)= X(\zet/p)^{C_p}+(\text{free part of }X(\zet/p)).$$
% Since the \gporder of $G$ is divisible by $p$, so is the cardinality of $X(\zet/p)$ \emph{and} of the free part of $X(\zet/p)$.  Hence, the number of fixed points is divisible by $p$, and it is not zero, so there must be nontrivial fixed points.

\footnote{Slight variations commented away% ALTERNATIVELY:
%   Consider  the $p-1$-fold product $(\bn{(p-1)}\to (\pt_G=\pt_G))$ of $\pt_G=\pt_G$ with itself.  We give this set the structure of a $\ZZ/p$-set as follows: ((here it is convenient to say that a $\ZZ/p$-set is the same as a $\ZZ$-set commuting with the $p$-fold cover)) define $X:S^1\to\Set$ by $X(\base)\defequi (\bn{(p-1)}\to (\pt_G=\pt_G))$ and by setting $X(\Sloop)$ to be the element in $X(\base)=(\base)$ sending $(g_1,\dots,g_{p-1})$ to $(g_2,\dots,g_{p-1},(g_1\cdots g_{p-1})^{-1})$.  Note that
% $$\xymatrix{S^1\ar[d]_{(-)^p}\ar[dr]^X&\\S^1\ar[r]_X&\Set}$$
% commutes and so we get a $\ZZ/p$-action ((expand)).  A fixed point of this action is an element of $X(\base)$ of the form $(g,g,\dots,g)$ such that $g^{p-1}=g^{-1}$  (expand)). The choice $g=e$ always gives such a fixed point, but if there is any other point ... (do you need decidability here?), the pointed map $S^1\to BG$ given by sending $\Sloop$ to $g$ gives the desired subgroup. Hence we need to show that $X$ has fixed points.

% Now, $X(\base)$ splits as a disjoint union of its orbits.  Since $p$ is prime, the group $\ZZ/p$ is simple ((where proved?)), and so the orbits are either singletons (fixed points) or free orbits:
% $$X(\base)= X(\base)^{\ZZ/p}+(\text{free part of }X(\base)).$$
% Since the \gporder of $G$ is divisible by $p$, so is the cardinality of $X(\base)$ \emph{and} of the free part of $X(\base)$.  Hence, the number of fixed points is divisible by $p$, and it is not zero, so there must be nontrivial fixed points.


% ALTERNATIVELY:
% Recall the cyclic group of order $p$.  For the sake of convenience, we identify $\bn p\times\bn 1$ and $\bn p$, so that elements will be denoted $0,1,2,\dots$ and not $(0,0), (1,0),(2,0)\dots$, and we also write $s$ instead of $\sqrt[p]{\id}$ for the element in $\bn p=\bn p$ that shifts to the successor (mod $p$).  In other words we choose an identification $\zet/p=(\bn p,s)$ once and for all.  If 
% $$(S,j):BC_p\defequi\sum_{S:\UU}\sum_{j:X=X}||(S,j)=(\bn p,s)||,$$ consider the set 
% $$X(S,j)\defequi\sum_{g:S\to (\pt_G=\pt_G)}||\sum_{a:(S,j)=(\bn p,s)}g_{a^{-1}(0)}\cdot\dots\cdot g_{a^{-1}(p-1)}=e_G||.$$ 
% Note that if $g:\bn p\to(\pt_G=\pt_G)$, then we have an equality of propositions
% $$||\sum_{a:(\bn p,s)=(\bn p,s)}g_{a^{-1}(0)}\cdot\dots\cdot g_{a^{-1}(p-1)}=e_G||=g_{0}\cdot\dots\cdot g_{p-1}=e_G$$
% since $(g_1\cdot\dots\cdot g_{p-1}=e_G)=(g_2\cdot\dots\cdot g_{p-1}\cdot g_1=e_G)$,
% and so 
% $$X(\bn p,s)=\sum_{g:\bn p\to (\pt_G=\pt_G)}g_{0}\cdot\dots\cdot g_{p-1}=e_G$$ 
% which is equivalent to the $p-1$-fold product of $\pt_G=\pt_G$ with itself ($g_0=(g_1\cdot\dots\cdot g_{p-1})^{-1}$, but all the other $g_i$s are then chosen arbitrarily).  Consequently, the number of elements in $X(\bn p,s)$ is divisible by $p$.

% Now, a $C_p$-fixed point of $X(\bn p,s)$ is an element $(g_0,\dots,g_{p-1},!)$ such that $(g_0,\dots,g_{p-1},!)=(g_1,\dots,g_{p-1},g_0,!)$, \ie $g_0=g_1=g_2=\dots=g_{p-1}$\footnote{if I am allowed to write that}.  In other words, a fixed point is of the form $(g,\dots,g,!)$, where $!$ expresses that $g^p=e_G$:
% $$X(\bn p,s)^{C_p}=\sum_{g:\pt_G=\pt_G}g^p=e_G.$$  If we can show that $(g,!):X(\bn p,s)^{C_p}$ is nonempty, we'd have established an abstract cyclic subgroup consisting of the powers of $g$.  Of course, setting $g=e_G$ will give us such a fixed point.

%  Now, $X(\bn p,s)$ splits as a disjoint union of its orbits.  Since $p$ is prime, the group $C_p$ is simple ((where proved?)), and so the orbits are either singletons (fixed points) or free orbits:
% $$X(\bn p,s)= X(\bn p,s)^{C_p}+(\text{free part of }X(\bn p,s)).$$
% Since the \gporder of $G$ is divisible by $p$, so is the cardinality of $X(\bn p,s)$ \emph{and} of the free part of $X(\bn p,s)$.  Hence, the number of fixed points is divisible by $p$, and it is not zero, so there must be nontrivial fixed points.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:nontrivcenter}
  Let be $G$ be a finite subgroup of \gporder $p^n$, where $p$ is prime and $n$ a positive integer.  
Then the center $Z(G)$ of $G$ is nontrivial. 
(point to center in the symmetry chapter)
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Recall the $G$-set $\Ad_G:BG\to\Set$ given by $Ad_G(z)=(z=z)$.  Then the map  $$\ev_{\pt_G}:\prod_{z:BG}(z=z)\to(\pt_G=\pt_G),\quad \ev_G(f)=f(\pt_G)$$  
has the structure of a (n abstract) inclusion of a subgroup; namely the inclusion of the center $Z(G)$ in $G$.  
The center thus represents the fixed points of the $G$-set $\Ad_G$.  
Since $G$ has \gporder a power of $p$, all orbits but the fixed points have cardinality divisible by $p$.  
Consequently, Burnside's lemma states that the number of fixed points, \ie the \gporder of $Z(G)$, must be divisible by $p$.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:orderpsquaredgroups}
  If $G$ is a noncyclic group of \gporder $p^2$, then $G$ of the form $C_p\times C_p$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  The center $Z(G)$ is by \cref{lem:nontrivcenter} of \gporder $p$ or $p^2$.
  Since $G$ is not cyclic we have that $g^p=e_G$ for all $g:\pt_G=\pt_G$.    
((To be continued: the classical proof involves choosing nontrivial elements  -- see what can be done about that))
\end{proof}
\section{Sylow's Theorems}
\label{sec:sylow}
\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:sylow1}
  If $p$ is a prime, $n:\NN$ and $G$ a finite group whose \gporder divides $p^n$, then $G$ has a subgroup of \gporder $p^n$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}\footnote{In this proof I refer to \cref{lem:aut-orbit} (which says that $N_G(K)/K$ is equivalent to the set of automorphisms of $G/K$ in the orbit category) to claim that the $K$-fixed points of $G/K$ may be identified with $N_G(K)/K$.   Also I use that the \gporder of a pullback of a subgroup $L$ along a surjection is the product of the \gporder of the kernel and the \gporder of $L$}
  We prove the result by induction on $n$.  
If $n=0$ we need to have a subgroup of \gporder $1$, which is witnessed by the trivial subgroup.
%If $n=1$, this is Cauchy's \cref{thm:cauchys}.  
If $n>0$, assume by induction that $G$ contains a subgroup $K$ of \gporder $p^{n-1}$.  
Now, $K$ acts on the set $G/K$.  
The cardinality of $G/K$ is divisible by $p$ (since $p^n$ divides the \gporder of $G$), and so by \cref{lem:fixedptsize} the fixed point set $(G/K)^K$ has cardinality divisible by $p$.  

Recall the normalizer subgroup $N_G(K)$ from \cref{sec:noether-theorems} -- the ``largest subgroup of $G$ containing $K$ as a normal subgroup''.
By \cref{lem:aut-orbit}, the quotient group $N_G(K)/K$ may be identified with $(G/K)^K$, and so has \gporder divisible by $p$.  
By Cauchy's \cref{thm:cauchys} there is a subgroup $L$ of $N_G(K)/K$ of \gporder $p$.  
Taking the preimage of $L$ under the projection $\mathrm{pr}:N_G(K)\to N_G(K)/K$ we obtain a subgroup $H$ of $N_G(K)$ of \gporder $p^n$ ($H$ is a free $K$-set with $p$ orbits).  The theorem is proven by considering $H$ as a subgroup of $G$.
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:sylowsubgroup}
  Let $p^n$ be the largest power of $p$ which divides the \gporder of $G$.  A subgroup of $G$ of \gporder $p^n$ is called a \emph{$p$-Sylow subgroup}\index{Sylow subgroup} of $G$.
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:numberofconjofSylow}
  Let $G$ be a finite group and $P$ a $p$-Sylow subgroup.  Then the number of conjugates of $P$ is not divisible by $p$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $X$ be the $G$-set of conjugates of $P$.  Being a $G$-orbit, $X$ is equivalent $G/\mathrm{Stab}_P$, where $P$ is the stabilizer subgroup of $P$.  Now, $P$ is contained in the stabilizer so the highest power of $p$ dividing the \gporder of $G$ also divides the \gporder of $\mathrm{Stab}_P$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:sylowsareconjugates}
  Let $G$ be a finite group, $H$ a subgroup of $G$ of \gporder $p^s$ and $P$ a $p$-Sylow subgroup of $G$.  Then $H$ is conjugate to a subgroup of $P$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  CLASSICAL:
  Consider the set $\mathcal O_P$ of conjugates of $P$ as an $H$-set.  Since the cardinality of $\mathcal O_P\simeq G/Stab_P$ is prime to $p$ there must be an $H$-fixed point $Q$.  In other words, $H\subseteq Stab_Q$.  By \cref{lem:thereisaconjugate} there is a conjugate $H'$ of $H$ with $H'\subseteq Stab_P$.  Now, $P\subseteq Stab_P$ (ref) is a normal subgroup and so by \cref{lem:iso2} 
\end{proof}
