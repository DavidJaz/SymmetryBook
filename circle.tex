\label{cha:circle}

An effective principle in mathematics is that when you want to study a certain 
phenomenon you should search for a single type that captures this phenomenon.  
Here are two examples
\begin{enumerate}
\item The contractible type $\bn 1$ has the property that given 
any type $A$ a function $\bn 1\to A$ provides exactly the 
same information as picking an element in $A$.
For, an equivalence from $A$ to $\bn 1\to A$ is provided by
the function $a \mapsto (x \mapsto a)$.
\item The type $\Prop$ of propositions has the property that 
given any type $A$ a function $A\to\Prop$ provides exactly 
the same information as picking a subtype of $A$.
\end{enumerate}
We are interested in symmetries, and so we should search for a type $X$ 
which is so that given \emph{any} type $A$ the type of functions 
$X\to A$ (or $A\to X$, but that's not what we're going to do) 
picks out exactly the symmetries in $A$.  
We will soon see that there is such a type: 
the circle which is built \emph{exactly} so that this 
``universality with respect to symmetries'' holds.  
It may be surprising to see how little it takes to define it; 
especially in hindsight when we eventually discover some of the many uses of the circle.

A symmetry in $A$ is an identification $p:a=_Aa$ for some $a:A$.  
Now, we can take any iteration of $p$ (composing $p$ with itself a number of times), 
and we can consider the inverse $p^{-1}$ and \emph{its} iterations.  
So, by giving one symmetry we at the same time give a lot of symmetries.  
For a particular $p$ it may be that not all of the iterations are different, 
for instance it may be that $p^2=p^0\defequi\refl a$ (like in \cref{xca:C2}), 
or even more dramatic: if  $p=\refl a$, then \emph{all} the iterates of $p$ are equal. 
However, in general we must be prepared that all the powers of $p$ 
(positive, $0$ and negative) are distinct. 
Hence, the circle must have a distinct symmetry for every integer. 
We would have enjoyed defining the integers this way, 
but being that ideological would be somewhat inefficient. 
Hence we give a more hands-on approach defining the circle 
and the integers separately. Thereafter we prove that the type of 
symmetries of the circle is equivalent to the set of integers. 

\section{The circle and its universal property}
\label{sec:S1}

Propositional truncation from \cref{sec:prop-trunc} was
the first \emph{higher inductive type}, that is, an inductive type
with constructors both for elements and for identifications,
we introduced. 
The circle is another example of a higher inductive type,
see \cite[Ch. 6]{hottbook} for more information.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:circle}
The circle is a type $\Sc:\UU$ with an element (constructor) $\base : \Sc$ and 
an identification (constructor) $\Sloop: \base=\base$. For convenience and
clarity the (higher) induction principle for $\Sc$ is explained
by first stating a recursion principle for $\Sc$.

Let $A$ be a type. In order to define a function $f:\Sc\to A$,
it suffices to give an element $a$ of $A$ together with an
identification $l$ of type $a=a$. The function $f$ defined
by this data satisfies $f(\base)\jdeq a$ and 
the recursion principle provides an (unnamed) element of 
$\ap{f}(\Sloop)=l$.\footnote{%
We use $\ap{f}(\Sloop)=l$ and not $\ap{f}(\Sloop)\jdeq l$ because
$\ap{f}$ has already been defined.}

Let $A(x)$ be a type for every $x:\Sc$. The induction principle of $\Sc$
states that, in order to prove $A(x)$ for every element $x$ of $\Sc$,
it suffices to give an element $a$ of $A(\base)$ together with an
identification $l$ of type $\pathover{a}{A}{\Sloop}{a}$. 
The function $f$ defined by this data satisfies $f(\base)\jdeq a$ and 
the induction principle provides an element of $\apd{f}(\Sloop)=l$.
\end{definition}

Giving $a$ as above is referred to as `the base case', and
giving $l$ as `the loop case'. Given this input data to define
a function $f$ will often be abbreviated by writing
$f(\base)\defeq a$ and $f(\Sloop)\defis l$.

The following result states that any function from the circle exactly 
picks out an element and a symmetry of that element.
This is a ``universal property'' of the circle.
\footnote{\color{blue}As promised, we now demonstrate that a function from the circle exactly 
picks out an element and a symmetry of that element}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:freeloopspace}
For all types $A$, the evaluation function 
\[
\ev_A : (\Sc\to A)\to \sum_{a:A}(a=_Aa)\text{~defined by~} 
\ev_A(g)\defeq (g(\base),g(\Sloop))
\]
is an equivalence, with inverse $\el_A$ defined by the recursion principle.  
%In particular, if $a:A$, the function $((\Sc,\base)\to_* (A,a))\to (a=_Aa)$ 
%given by sending $g:\Sc\to A$ to $g(\Sloop)$ is an equivalence. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Fix $A:\UU$. We apply \cref{lem:weq-iso}. 
For all $a:A$ and $l:a=a$ we have $\ev(\el(a,l))=(a,l)$
by the recursion principle. It remains to prove
$\el(\ev(f))=f$ for all $f:\Sc\to A$. This will follow
from the following more general result. Assume 
$p: f(\base)= g(\base)$ and $q: f(\Sloop) = p^{-1}\cdot g(\Sloop)\cdot p$.
We show $f=g$, for which it suffices to prove by circle induction
that $P(x)\defeq(f(x)=g(x))$ for all $x:\Sc$.
For the base case we take $p$.
The loop case reduces to $\trp{P,\Sloop}(p)=p$ by \cref{def:pathover-trp}.
By \cref{lem:trp-in-fx=Ygx} we have 
$\trp{P,\Sloop}(p)=g(\Sloop)\cdot p \cdot f(\Sloop)^{-1}$. 
By $q$ we have $g(\Sloop) = p\cdot f(\Sloop) \cdot p^{-1}$.
Hence $\trp{P,\Sloop}(p)=p$ by easy calculation.
To finally get $\el(\ev(f))=f$,
note that $\ev(\el(\ev(f)))=(f(\base),f(\Sloop))$ with $p\defeq\refl{f(\base)}$
and $q$ coming from the induction principle.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
A function $f:\Sc\to A$ is often called a \emph{loop} in $A$, 
the picture being that $f$ throws $\Sloop:\base=\base$ as a lasso in the type $A$.

  Under univalence, so that $a=_Aa$ is identified with the pointed functions 
from the circle, this allows for a very graphic interpretation of the 
symmetries in $a=_Aa$: they are all in the image of a function $g$ from 
the circle: they are loops in the type $A$ starting and ending at $a$! ((picture!!))
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:circleisconnected}
  The circle is connected.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We show $\Trunc{\base=z}$ for all $z:\Sc$ by circle induction
as in \cref{def:circle}.
For the base case we take $\trunc{\refl{\base}}$.
The loop case is immediate as $\Trunc{\base=\base}$ is a proposition.
\end{proof}

In the proof above, the propositional truncation coming 
from the definition of connectedness is essential.
If this truncation were removed we wouldn't know what to do in
the induction step (actually, ${\base=z}$ for all $z:\Sc$ contradicts UA).
This said, the family $R:\Sc\to\UU$ with $R(z)\defequi (\base=z)$ is extremely 
important for other purposes. We will call it in \cref{def:universalcover} the 
``universal \covering'' of the circle and is the key tool in proving that 
the set of integers and the symmetries of the circle coincide.

In order to do this we should properly define the set of integers 
and explore the concept of \coverings.

\section{The integers}
\label{sec:integers}

We define the type of integers in one of the many possible ways.

\begin{definition}\label{def:integers}\label{def:zet}
Let $\zet$ be the inductive type with the following three constructors:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $z_0: \zet$ for the integer number zero, 
$0 \defeq z_0$
\item $pos: \NN \to \zet$ for positive numbers,
$1 \defeq pos(0),\ldots$.
\item $neg: \NN \to \zet$ for negative numbers, 
$-1 \defeq neg(0),\ldots$
\end{enumerate}

The \emph{embedding} function $i:\NN\to\zet$ is defined by induction,
setting $i(0)\defeq z_0$, $i(S(n))\defeq pos(n)$.
Like the type $\NN$, the type $\zet$ is a set with decidable equality
and ordering relations,
and we denote its elements often in the usual way as $\ldots,-1,0,1,\ldots$.

One well-known equivalence is \emph{negation} ${-}:\zet\to\zet$, 
also called \emph{complement}, inductively defined by setting 
$-z_0\defeq z_0$, 
$-pos(n)\defeq neg(n)$, 
$-neg(n)\defeq pos(n)$.
Negation is its own inverse.

The \emph{successor} function $s:\zet\to\zet$ is defined inductively setting 
$s(z_0)\defeq pos(0)$, 
$s(pos(n))\defeq pos(S(n))$,
$s(neg(n))\defeq -i(n)$. For example, we have
$s(-1)\jdeq s(neg(0))\jdeq -i(0) \jdeq z_0 \jdeq 0$.
By induction on $n:\NN$ one proves $s(i(n))=i(S(n))$, 
so that one can say that $s$ extends $S$
on the $i$-image of $\NN$. 

The successor function $s$ is an equivalence.
It is instructive to depict iterating $s$ in both directions as 
a doubly infinite sequence containing all integers:
\[
\ldots \mapsto neg(1) \mapsto neg(0) \mapsto z_0 \mapsto pos(0) \mapsto pos(1) \mapsto \ldots
\]

The inverse $s^{-1}$ of $s$ is called the \emph{predecessor} function.
We recall the $n$-fold iteration $s^n$ defined earlier;
the $n$-fold iteration of $s^{-1}$ will be denoted by $s^{-n}$.

Addition of integers is defined inductively by setting
$z + z_0\defeq z$, 
$z + pos(n)\defeq s^{n+1}(z)$, 
$z + neg(n)\defeq s^{-(n+1)}(z)$.
Again, addition extends $+$ on the $i$-image of $\NN$,
see \cref{xca:addition-on-Z-and-N}. 
From addition and unary $-$ one can define a binary
\emph{substraction} function setting $z-y \defeq z+(-y)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{xca}\label{xca:addition-on-Z-and-N}
Show that $i(n+m)=i(n)+i(m)$ for all $n,m:\NN$.
\end{xca}

Ordering relations $<$ and $\leq$ on $\zet$ are easily defined
and shown to extend those on $\NN$.

Like any other inductive type, the type $\zet$ comes with an
induction principle. Let $T(z)$ be a family of types indexed by $z:\zet$.
In order to construct an element $f(z)$ of $T(z)$ for all $z:\zet$,
it suffices to give $f(0): T(0)$ and to give functions $g$ and $h$ such
that $g(n): T(pos(n))$ and $h(n): T(neg(n))$ for all $n:\NN$.
Here $g$ and $h$ can be defined by induction on $n:\NN$.
Instead of defining $g$ and $h$ explicitly, we will often
define $g'$ and $h'$ such that $g'(z): T(z)\to T(z+1)$ 
for all $z:\zet$ with $z\geq 0$, and $h'(z): T(z)\to T(z-1)$ 
for all $z:\zet$ with $z\leq 0$. The function $f$ thus defined
satisfies $f(z+1)\jdeq g'(z,f(z))$ for all $z\geq 0$,
and $f(z-1)\jdeq h'(z,f(z))$ for all $z\leq 0$.


\section{\Coverings}
\label{sec:covering}

As mentioned earlier, it is possible to define the integers as the
type $\base=_{S^1}\base$ of symmetries of the circle.
Our investigation of $\base=_{S^1}\base$ will use the concept of \coverings.
%, a concept custom-built for exposing symmetries (and subsymmetries) of types.  
Since we are going to return to this concept several times, 
we take the time for a fuller treatment before we continue with
proving the equivalence of $\base=_{S^1}\base$ and $\zet$.

\begin{definition}\label{def:covering}
A \emph{\covering} over a type $B$ 
is a map $f:A\to B$ such that for each $b:B$ the preimage $f^{-1}(b)$ is a set.
We say that a \covering $f:A\to B$ over $B$ is
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{connected}\index{connected \covering} if $A$ is connected, 
\item \emph{universal}\index{universal \covering} if $A$ and all 
the identity types $a=_Aa$ (for $a:A$) are connected, 
\item \emph{finite}\index{finite \covering} if all preimages are finite sets,
\item \emph{decidable}\index{decidable \covering} if all preimages are decidable sets.
\end{itemize}
If $B$ is a pointed type, a \emph{pointed} \covering is a pointed map $f:A\to_*B$ such that, when forgetting the points, $f_\div:A_\div\to B_\div$ is a \covering. Here we only
require $A$ to be a pointed type. Of course we do get the base point of $A$ in the 
preimage of the base point of $B$, but we do not require the preimages of $f_\div$
to be pointed types.
%consist of a type $A$, a function $f:A\to B$
%and a proof that for all $b:B$ the preimage $f^{-1}(b)$ is a set.
\end{definition}
With a formula, given a type $B$, the type of \coverings over $B$ is
\[
\sum_{A:\UU}\sum_{f:A\to B}\prod_{b:B}\isset(f^{-1}(b)),
\]
with variations according to the flavor.

Recall the equivalence in \cref{lem:Prop-Set-pointed-families}(\ref{lem:Set-families})
between the type $B\to\Set$ of families of sets indexed by $B$, and the type
of set bundles over $B$ given above.
We shall frequently use this equivalence, even without explicit mention.

We should notice that the notion of a \covering is just one step up from the notion of an
injection (a map such that all the preimages are propositions -- 
following the logic, injections perhaps ought to be called ``proposition bundles''). 
The formulation we give is not the only one and for some purposes a formulation
based on $B\to\Set$ is more convenient.

\begin{xca}\label{xca:constant-cover}
Let $A$ and $B$ be types, and let $b$ be an element of $B$.
Show that the function that is constant $b$ is a \covering
if and only if both $A$ and $b=b$ are sets. SPLIT AND EXTEND WITH COMPOSITION
\end{xca}

Figure~\ref{fig:covering} visualizes two examples of \coverings over the circle.  
Consider the picture on the left first.  
If we let $b$ be the element on the circle marked at the bottom left hand side, then the preimage $f^{-1}(b)$ is marked by the the two dots in $A$ straight above $b$, 
so that in this case each preimage contains two points (is \emph{merely equal} to $\bn 2$).  
However, $A$ is not the constant family, like $A'$ depicted on the right, since 
$A'=\sum_{z:\Sc}\bn 2=\Sc\times\bn 2=\Sc+\Sc$ is not connected.  
Obviously something way more fascinating is going on.

\end{figure}

\begin{remark}
  It \emph{is} possible to misunderstand what a ``connected \covering'' is: 
the other interpretation ``all the preimages are connected'' simply 
would give us an equivalence (since connected sets are contractible),
and this is \emph{not} what is intended. (Equivalences are \coverings, but not necessarily connected \coverings and connected \coverings are not neccesarily equivalences.)  

Likewise, for the other qualifications; for instance in a ``finite covering'' $f:A\to B$, the type $A$ is usually \emph{not} a finite set. 

  We trust the reader to keep our definitions in mind and not the other interpretations.
\end{remark}


\begin{remark}
  \Coverings are closely related to a concept from topology called ``covering space'' (or any variant thereof, including Galois theory) and from algebra as sheaves (of sets).  Either way, the concept is useful because it singles out the (sub)symmetries.  
\end{remark}

% \begin{remark} MB: HAS BEEN MOVED TO A PLACE WHERE IT IS DIRECTLY USED
%\label{rem:setfamloopinj}
% We recall \cref{cor:fib-vs-path} stating that all the fibers of a map $f:A\to B$ 
% are sets if and only if each  $$\ap{f}: (a=a')\to (f(a)=f(a'))$$ is an injection.
%\end{remark}

% \begin{definition}\label{def:decktrafo}\footnote{postpone}
%   Let $f:A\to B$ be a \covering.  A symmetry $(A,f,!)=(A,f,!)$ is called a \emph{deck transformation}.
% \end{definition}
%specified by a pair $(p_A,p_f)$ with consisting of a $p_A:A=_{\UU}A'$, a $p_f:f'p_A=_{A\to B}f$.

\begin{example}\label{xca:coveringsofS1}
Let us consider \coverings over the circle, most conveniently 
for the moment in the guise of families 
$$E:\Sc\to\Set.$$
By circle induction, giving such an $E$ is the same as 
specifying a set $E(\base)$ and a symmetry $E(\Sloop):E(\base)=E(\base)$.  
Said more concisely in terms of \cref{lem:freeloopspace}, 
the type of \coverings over the circle is equivalent to 
$$\sum_{X:\Set}(X=X).$$ \footnote{\color{blue}%
DUPLICATE, BETTER LATER
We will ultimately show that the circle $\Sc$ is equivalent to the 
component (see \cref{def:connected}) $C$ of $(\zet,\etop{s})$ in $\sum_{X:\Set}(X=X)$,  
where $s:\zet\to\zet$ is the successor.  This may seem circular: ``the circle is equivalent to a component of the type of \coverings over the circle!'' 
(MB WHY CIRCULAR: $\sum_{X:\Set}(X=X)$ EXISTS ALSO INDEP OF CIRCLE?)
but it really just condenses the idea that connected groupoids are uniquely 
given by their symmetries.}
\end{example}
A particularly important example is the following:
\begin{definition}\label{def:RtoS1}
Define $R:\Sc\to\UU$ by circle induction by setting 
$R(\base)\defeq\zet$ and $R(\Sloop)\defis \etop{s}$.
Since $\zet$ is a set, and being a set is a proposition,
one can prove by circle induction that $R(z)$ is a set for all $z:\Sc$.
(Abusing notation we also write $R:\Sc\to\Set$.) Now define
$$\RR\defeq\sum_{z:\Sc}R(z)$$
and let the first projection denoted by
$$\exp:\RR\to \Sc$$
be the \emph{exponential \covering of the circle}.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  \label{rem:expforreal}
  The reason for the name $\exp:\RR\to \Sc$ comes from the following visualization.  
%Consider the real and complex numbers $\RR$ and $\mathbb C$.  
If $x$ is a real number, then the complex exponentiation 
$e^{2\pi i x}=\cos(2\pi x)+i\sin(2\pi x)$ has absolute value $1$ and 
so defines a continuous function from the real numbers to the unit circle.  
Choosing any point $z$ on the unit circle, we see that the preimage of $z$ under the exponential function is a shifted copy of the integers inside the reals. 
 
This connection between the integers and the unit circle is precisely captured in a form that we can take further by the \covering $\exp:\RR\to \Sc$.
\end{remark}

We already defined a \covering $f:A\to B$ to be universal if $A$ is connected
and all $a=_A a$ (for $a:A$) are connected. 
If moreover $B$ is a pointed, connected groupoid we shall argue that
we actually can speak of \emph{the} universal \covering.

Recall \cref{cor:fib-vs-path} stating that all the fibers of a map $f:A\to B$ 
are sets if and only if each 
\[
\ap{f}: (a=a')\to (f(a)=f(a'))
\]
is an injection. Assume $B$ is a groupoid.
We prove that $A$ is contractible. 
Being contractible is a proposition, so we may assume 
we have an element $a$ of $A$ since $A$ is connected. 
By \cref{xca:connected-trivia} and \ref{xca:component-connected} 
it suffices to prove that $a=a$ is contractible.
By \cref{xca:prop-set-trivia}, using that $a=a$ is connected,
it suffices to show that $a=a$ is a set.
Using that $\ap{f}$ is an injection, we can apply the remark after
\cref{lem:sum-of-fibers} and obtain that $a=a$ is a set since
$f(a)=f(a)$ is a set, since $B$ is a groupoid.
This completes the proof that $A$ is contractible.

Now assume $(B,b_0)$ is a pointed connected groupoid and $f:A\to B$
a universal \covering. We first prove the proposition $\Trunc{f^{-1}(b_0)}$.
In doing so we may assume an element of $A$. Since $B$ is connected
we have $\Trunc{b_0 = f(a)}$. Again we may assume an element $p: b_0=f(a)$.
Thus $\trunc{(a,p)}:\Trunc{f^{-1}(b_0)}$. 
We can now replay the above argument that $A$ is contractible starting
with a pair $(a,p)$ in $f^{-1}(b_0)$, so that $p: b_0 = f(a)$.
Note that, since $A$ is contractible and $B$ is a groupoid,
$f^{-1}(b)$ is equivalent to the set $b_0 = b$.
This leads to the following definition.\footnote{%
If $B$ is a pointed connected groupoid,
\emph{any} universal \covering is merely equal to \emph{the} universal \covering.
This should be good enough.}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:universalcover}
  Let $(B,b_0)$ be a pointed connected groupoid.  
The \emph{universal \covering}\footnote{for $B$ not a groupoid this is total misuse of language.  I feel sort of bad about it, but I did not want to say ``path fibration''} of $B$ is the \covering of $B$ given by the family of sets 
  $$\uc{b_0}:B\to\Set,\quad \uc{b_0}(b)\defequi (b_0=_Bb),$$
or alternatively as the first projection from $\uc{b_0}B\defequi\sum_{b:B}(b_0=_Bb)$ to $B$. 
\end{definition}
Note that $(b_0=_B b)$ is a family of \emph{sets} exactly when $B$ is a groupoid. 
However, we have \cref{lem:thepathspaceiscontractible} for any type $B$.

\begin{remark}
  What's so ``universal'' about this?
  %This seems to deflates the concept ``universal \covering'' of a pointed connected groupoid $(B,b_0)$, since we've just shown that t
The universal \covering over the pointed connected groupoid $(B,b_0)$ coincides with the constant function $c_{b_0}:\bn 1\to B$ (with value $b_0$), and seems like an unnecessary complicated representation were it not for the manifold practical value of the formulation that we've given.  
In particular, we recognize the set of symmetries $b_0=_Bb_0$ as the preimage of $b_0$ under the first projection from $\uc{b_0}B$ to $B$; ultimately this will show that the study of symmetries coincides with the study of the universal \covering.

The first instance of this comes already in the next section, where we show in \cref{cor:S1groupoid} that the symmetries of the circle is given by the set of integers $\zet$ by showing that the universal \covering and the exponential \covering (\cref{def:RtoS1}) of the circle coincide.

That said, one way to see that the constant function $c_{b_0}:\bn 1\to B$, \emph{does} deserve the label universal because if given any function $f:A\to B$ and an $(a_0,p): f^{-1}(b_0)$, then we get a function $c_{a_0}:\bn 1\to A$ and $p:b_0=f(a_0)$ gives an element in $c_{b_0}=_{\bn 1\to B}f\, c_{a_0}$.  In other words, any such $f$ is ``a factor of $c_{b_0}$''.  
Note, however, that this depends on $f^{-1}(b_0)$ being non-empty (classically, this is often demanded of a covering, which distinguishes it from our \coverings), and the factorization depends on the element $(a_0,p)$ used. 
\end{remark}



\section{The symmetries of the circle}
\label{sec:pi1S1isZ}\label{sec:symcirc}

With the set $\zet$ of integers \emph{defined} as in \cref{sec:integers}, 
we will now \emph{prove} that $\zet$ is equivalent to the type 
$\base=_{\Sc}\base$, and that under this equivalence $0:\zet$ corresponds to 
$\refl{\base}:\base=\base$, and $1$ to $\Sloop$, and $-1$ to $\Sloop^{-1}$. 
More generally, the successor $\etop{s}:\zet=\zet$ corresponds to composition with $\Sloop$
and the predecessor corresponds to composition with $\Sloop^{-1}$.

The first step is to prove that the exponential \covering \cref{def:RtoS1} 
is equal to the universal \covering in \cref{def:universalcover}, 
\ie we prove that the family 
\[
R: \Sc\to\UU,\qquad R(\base)\defeq\zet,\, R(\Sloop)\defis \etop{s}
\]
is equal to the family
\[
\uc{\base}:\Sc\to\UU,\qquad \uc{\base}(z)\defeq (\base=z).
\]
What does it mean for the families $\uc{\base}$ and $R$ to be equal?
Type families are a special case of functions. 
Function extensionality reduces the question to pointwise equality
of $\uc{\base}$ and $R$ as functions.
Using univalence, it suffices to give
an equivalence from $\uc{\base}(z)$ to $R(z)$, for every $z:\Sc$.

%We define two functions, $f:\uc{\base}\to R$ and $g:R\to \uc{\base}$ and show that, 
% under univalence, they define inverse identities.  

We first recall from \cref{sec:heavy-transport} how 
transport behaves in families of function types.  
Given a type $A$ and two type families $P,Q:A\to\UU$, 
%$P\to Q$ is shorthand for the type $(P\to Q) \jdeq \prod_{a:A}(P(a)\to Q(a)$.  
transport along $p:a=_Aa'$ of $f:P(a)\to Q(a)$ is $Q(p)\,f\,P(p)^{-1}:P(a')=Q(a')$.
In a picture
\[
\xymatrix{
P(a)\ar[rr]^{f}\ar@{=}[d]^{P(p)}_\downarrow&&
  Q(a)\ar@{=}[d]^{Q(p)}_\downarrow\\
P(a')&&\,Q(a').}
\]
If $A$ is $\Sc$, then the induction principle for the circle says 
that giving an $f(z):P(z)\to Q(z)$ for all $z:\Sc$ is the same as 
specifying an $f(\base):P(\base)=Q(\base)$ and an identity 
$f(\Sloop):Q(\Sloop)\,f(\base)\,P(\Sloop)^{-1}=_{P(\base)\to Q(\base)}f(\base)$,
\ie a witness that the composites in 
$$\xymatrix{
  P(\base)\ar[rr]^{f(\base)}\ar@{=}[d]^{P(\Sloop)}_\downarrow
 &&Q(\base)\ar@{=}[d]^{Q(\Sloop)}_\downarrow\\
  P(\base)\ar[rr]^{f(\base)}&&\,Q(\base)}
$$
are equal.  If $P,Q$ are families of sets, 
then the type of $f(\Sloop)$ is a proposition.

We now define two fiberwise maps that will turn out to give
inverse equivalences between $\uc{\base}(z)$ and $R(z)$, for each $z:\Sc$.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:fPtoR}
  The function $f:\prod_{z:\Sc}(\uc{\base}(z)\to R(z))$ is defined by transport: $f(z)(p)\defequi\trp{R,p}(0)$.
\end{definition}

In Figure~\ref{fig:transportalongloop}, the transport in the definition
above has been visualised for $p={\Sloop^n}$, $n=-2,-1,0,1,2$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:windingnumber}
For $f$ as in \cref{def:fPtoR} we have $f(\base)(\Sloop^n)=n$ for all $n:\zet$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By induction on $n:\zet$.  In the base case $n=0$ we have
$f(\base)(\Sloop^0)\defeq f(\refl\base)\defeq 0$.
For $n=s(m)$ with $m:\NN$ we have\footnote{some references needed here} 
\begin{align*}
  f(\base)(\Sloop^{s(m)})&\defeq\trp{R,\Sloop^{s(m)}}(0)\\
  &=\trp{R,\Sloop \Sloop^{m}}(0)\\
  &=\trp{R,\Sloop}(\trp{R,\Sloop^m}(0))\\
  &=s(\trp{R,\Sloop^m}(0)).
\end{align*}
The last equality follows from $\etop{s}=R(\Sloop)$ using
$s=\cast(\ua(s))=\cast(\etop{s})=\trp{\id_\UU,\etop{s}}=\trp{R,\Sloop}$, 
see \cref{def:idtoeq} and \cref{def:univalence}.
For negative $n$ the proof is similar.
\end{proof}

In the definition of the second map, 
take into account that $R(\base)\jdeq \zet$ and $\uc{\base}(\base) \jdeq (\base=\base)$.

\begin{definition}\label{def:gRtoP}
The function $g:\prod_{z:\Sc}(R(z)\to \uc{\base}(z))$ is 
defined by circle induction: 
\[
g(\base)\defeq {\Sloop^{-}}:\zet\to(\base=\base) : n \mapsto {\Sloop^n}
\]
and 
\[
g(\Sloop): \uc{\base}(\Sloop)\, g(\base)\,R(\Sloop)^{-1}=_{\zet\to (\base=\base)} g(\base).
\]
So far we have only given the type of $g(\Sloop)$. By definition, $R(\Sloop)$ is $s$
and $\uc{\base}(\Sloop)$ is composition with $\Sloop$.
In a picture, $g(\Sloop)$ should prove that it does not matter what 
path you take around the square
$$\xymatrix{\zet\ar[rr]^{\Sloop^-}\ar@{=}[d]^s_\downarrow
 &&(\base=\base)\ar@{=}[d]^{\Sloop\cdot\_}_\downarrow\\
  \zet\ar[rr]^{\Sloop^-}&&\,(\base=\base).}
$$
This follows by a simple calculation: ${\Sloop\,\Sloop^{n-1}} = {\Sloop^n}$, 
for all $n:\zet$. 
\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:univisexp}
For every $z:\Sc$, the functions $f(z)$ defined in \cref{def:fPtoR} 
and $g(z)$ in \cref{def:gRtoP} are inverse equivalences between
$\uc{\base}(z)$ and $R(z)$.
%$\uc{\base}$ defines a connected \covering of the circle: $\uc{\base}(z)\defeq (\base=z)$ is a set for all $z:\Sc$ and the type $\uc{\base} \Sc$ is connected (more precisely, by univalence $\uc{\base}(z)$ is equal to the set $R(z)$ and $\uc{\base} \Sc$ is contractible).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We apply \cref{lem:weq-iso} and verify the two conditions.
  Firstly, we need to give elements $H(z,p):g(z)(f(z)(p))=p$
for all $z:\Sc$ and $p:\uc{\base}(z)\defeq(\base=z)$. 
By induction on $z$ and $p:\base=z$ it suffices to set 
$H(\base,\refl\base)\defeq\refl{\refl{\base}}$ since
$g(\base)(f(\base)(\refl{\base}))\jdeq g(\base)(0)\jdeq\refl{\base}$.

Secondly, we need to give elements $G(z)(n):f(z)\,g(z)(n))=n$
for all $z:\Sc$ and $n: R(z)$.
By circle induction it suffices to define $G(\base)$ and $G(\Sloop)$,
but since $\zet$ is a set the information for $G(\Sloop)$ is redundant.
Hence, we need to show that for all $n:\zet$ that 
$f(\base)(g(\base)(n))\jdeq  f(\base)(\Sloop^n)$ is equal to $n$.  
This follows from \cref{lem:windingnumber}. 
\end{proof}


\begin{corollary}\label{cor:S1groupoid}
The circle $\Sc$ is a groupoid, and the function
%$\uc{\base}$ is a \covering, NOT NEEDED
\[
{\Sloop}^{-} : \zet\to(\base=_{\Sc}\base) %\text{sending $n$ to ${\Sloop}^n$}
\]
sending $n$ to $\Sloop^n$ is an equivalence.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
For any $z:\Sc$, the type $\uc{\base}(z)\jdeq (base=_{\Sc}z)$ is a set 
since $R(z)$ is a set and $\uc{\base}(z) \equiv R(z)$.
Since the circle is connected and being a set is a proposition, it follows
that $y=_{\Sc}z$ is a set, for any $y,z:\Sc$. Hence $\Sc$ is a groupoid.
By \cref{def:gRtoP}, ${\Sloop}^{-}\jdeq g(\base)$ is an equivalence.
\end{proof}


\section{A reinterpretation of the circle}
% and a criterion for equivalence through \coverings}
\label{sec:S1isC}
In this section we return to the considerations discussed in \cref{xca:coveringsofS1}.
Through \cref{lem:freeloopspace} we can get a different perspective on the circle which highlights it as a type classifying very simple symmetries.
By \cref{lem:freeloopspace} (moving up one universe), a type family $\Sc\to\UU$ is uniquely given by a type $X:\UU$ together with a $i:X=_\UU X$, with no further requirements on $i$.
Using UA, any type $X$ and any equivalence $f: X\equiv X$ provides such a pair
$(X,\etop{f})$. We have seen one example in \cref{def:RtoS1}, 
namely the set $\zet$ of integers together with the successor $s: \zet\equiv\zet$.

The importance of the latter example will become apparent when we eventually 
explain that \emph{the circle is equivalent to the connected component of 
$(\zet,\etop{s})$ in the type $\sum_{X:\UU}(X=_{\UU}X)$}. 

Heading towards this goal, we investigate this component a bit further.
Define the type family $D$ by $D(X) \defeq (X=X)$ for all $X:\UU$.
Recall from \cref{lem:isEq-pair=} that, given $X:\UU$ and $i: X=X$, 
the identity type $(\zet,\etop{s}) = (X,i)$
is equivalent to the type of pairs consisting of a $p:\zet=X$ and 
a proof of $\pathover{\etop{s}}{D}{p}{i}$. The latter type is
equivalent to $\trp{D,p}(\etop{s}) = i$ by \cref{def:pathover-trp}.
The transport is by conjugation,
\cref{xca:trp-in-a/x=b/x}(\ref{trp-in-x=x}), so that the latter
type is equivalent to $p\cdot\etop{s}\cdot p^{-1} = i$, 
and to $p\cdot\etop{s} = i\cdot p$, or $p \etop{s} = i p$ for short. 
In total, the identity type $(\zet,\etop{s})=(X,i)$ is equivalent to
\[
\sum_{p: {\zet = X}} {p \etop{s}} =_{\zet=X} {i p}.
\] 
Since $\zet$ is a set, this sum type is a set.
In particular, the type of symmetries $(\zet,\etop{s})=(\zet,\etop{s})$
is equivalent to the set $\sum_{p:\zet=\zet}p\etop{s}=\etop{s}p$.  

% and so our component $C$ is a connected groupoid. LATER FROM C=S1

This discussion tells us that the following definition makes sense:

\begin{definition}\label{def:S1toC}
Let $C$ be the component of $\sum_{X:\UU}(X=_{\UU}X)$ containing $(\zet,\etop{s})$.
Define by circle induction
\[
c:\Sc\to C \text{~setting~} 
c(\base)\defequi (\zet,\etop{s},\trunc{\refl{(\zet,\etop{s})}})
\]
and $c(\Sloop): c(\base)=_C c(\base)$ given by the successor 
$\etop{s}:\zet=\zet$ and trivial proofs of the proposition
$\etop{s}\etop{s}=\etop{s}\etop{s}$ and the proposition for the 
truncated third component of $c(\base)$.
\end{definition}

We will henceforth leave out the third component from the denotation
of elements of $C$, since its type is propositional and does not convey 
any information beyond its mere existence. We may write a ``!'' in order
to remind the reader of hidden information of propositional type.
  
We start by identifying the symmetries of $(\zet,\etop{s})$ in $C$:

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:IdCisZet}
Any element in $(\zet,\etop{s})=_C(\zet,\etop{s})$ is of 
the form $\pathpair{\etop{s}^k}{!}$ for some unique $k:\zet$.  
In other words, the function 
\[
\ev_0:((\zet,\etop{s})=_C(\zet,\etop{s}))\to \zet 
\text{~defined by~} \ev_0(\pathpair{p}{!}) \defeq \ptoe{p}(0)
\]
is an equivalence.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Given $\pathpair{p}{!}:(\zet,\etop{s})=_C(\zet,\etop{s})$ we must determine 
$p:\zet=\zet$. By univalence this amounts to giving all the values 
$\ptoe{p}(n)$ for $n:\zet$.  However, since $s\ptoe{p}=\ptoe{p}s$ we 
get that $\ptoe{p}(n+1)=\ptoe{p}(n)+1$ for all $n:\zet$. 
Induction on $n:\zet$ (positive and negative $n$ separately) gives that 
$\ptoe{p}(n)=n+\ptoe{p}(0)$. Hence $\ptoe{p}=s^{\ptoe(0)}$, so $p=\etop{s}^k$
for some unique $k:\zet$.
\end{proof}

We are going to prove that $c$ is an equivalence.
The method of proof will be used on several occasions.
Therefore we isolate the following general result first.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:conn-eq-f-ap-f-x}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be connected types, $x$ an element of $X$,
and $f$ a function from $X$ to $Y$. Then $f$ is an equivalence
if and only if $\ap{f}: (x=x) \to (f(x)=f(x))$ is an equivalence.
\end{lemma} 
\begin{proof}
Using \cref{cor:fib-vs-path}(\ref{conn-fib-vs-path}) it suffices to show that 
each $\ap{f}$ is an equivalence if and only if the specific $\ap{f}$ with 
domain $x=x$ is an equivalence. Being an equivalence is a proposition, 
so this follows in two easy steps from $X$ being connected,
using \cref{xca:component-connected}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:S1bysymmetries}
  The function $c:\Sc\to C$ from \cref{def:S1toC} is an equivalence.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  In view of \cref{lem:conn-eq-f-ap-f-x} we only need to show that 
$\ap{c}:(\base=_{\Sc}\base)\to((\zet,s)=_C(\zet,s))$ is an equivalence.
\footnote{ ((can we call equivalences between sets bijections?)). YES, BUT NOT NEEDED}
Note that both the domain and the co-domain of $\ap{c}$ is equivalent to $\zet$.
Consider the following diagram in which we compose $c$ with the equivalences
from \cref{cor:S1groupoid} and \cref{lem:IdCisZet}:
\[
\xymatrix{
\zet\ar[rr]^-{\Sloop^{{-}}}&&
(\base=\base)\ar[rr]^-{\ap{c}}&&
((\zet,s)=_C(\zet,s))\ar[rr]^-{\ev_0}&&
\zet}
\]
For $c$ to be an equivalence, it suffices to show that the composition
is the identity on $\zet$. By definition $\ap{c}(\Sloop) = \pathpair{\etop{s}}{!}$, 
and by induction on $n:\zet$
one shows  $\ev_0(\ap{c}(\Sloop^n))=\ev_0(\pathpair{\etop{s}^n}{!}) = s^n(0) = n$. 
% The composition with the functions $\Sloop^-:\zet\to (\base=_{\Sc}\base)$ sending $n:\zet$ to $\Sloop^n$ and $\ev_0:((\zet,s)=_C(zet,s))\to \zet$ of \cref{lem:IdCisZet} given by $\ev_0(p)=p(0)$ gives us a function $w:\zet\to\zet$ with $w(n)=s^n(0)$.  From \cref{cor:S1groupoid} we know that $\Sloop^-$ is an equivalence, so we only need to show that $w$ is an equivalence
\footnote{I may have used 2-out-of-3 before, we probably need to include it somewhere, though by univalence it hardly seems necessary}% .  If $p:\zet=\zet$ with $!:sp=ps$, we get by induction on $n:\zet$ (induction for positive and negative $n$ separately) that $p(n)=n+p(0)$.  Hence, all the elements in the preimage $w^{-1}(p,!:sp=ps)$ are equal to $(p(0),!)$.  
\end{proof}

% Now, consider the function 
% $$f:\sum_{p:\zet=\zet}(sp=ps)\to\zet,\qquad f(p,!)=p(0).$$  If $a:\zet$, then $f^{-1}(a)$ consists of the $p:\zet=\zet$ with $sp=ps$ and $p(0)=a$ (the last two are propositions), but by induction we see that $p(n)=n+a$ for all $n:\zet$ (separate induction on positive and negative numbers).  In other words, all elements in the set $f^{-1}(a)$ are equal, and so $f$ is an equivalence


%   ((TODO))
% As an illustration of things to come in a simpler setting, we can give the torsor definition of the circle, where Marc makes the simplifying observation that (since the integers is free on one generator) this can be coded in terms of the successor and there is a priori no need to talk about the abstract group.  In short: an (abstract) $\ZZ$-set is uniquely given by a set $X$ with an identity $f: X=_{\Set}X$.  A $\ZZ$-torsor $(X,f)$ is a $\ZZ$-set (merely) equal to $(\zet,S)$ ($S$ is the successor), that, there is a $p:X=\zet$, so that $Sp=_{X=X} pf$.  This is based at (the pricipal $\ZZ$-torsor represented by) $(\zet,S)$ and $(\zet,S)=(\zet,S)$ consists of $f:\zet=\zet$ s.t. $Sf=fS$.  Such an $f$ must be given by addition by the integer $f(0)$.  This gives us an equivalence between $\Sc$ and the type of (secret) $\ZZ$-torsors.  This will be trivial if we have shown that a map of connected groupoids is an equivalence if it induces an equivalence on the identity sets.

\section{Other \coverings over the circle}
\label{sec:covS1}

Let $A$ be a type and $f:A\to \Sc$ a function.
By \cref{cor:fib-vs-path}(\ref{set-fib-vs-path}), $f$ is a \covering
over $\Sc$ if and only if each $\ap{f}$ is injective.
Assume that $f:A\to \Sc$ is a \covering with $A$ is connected.
Let $(a_0,p)$ be an element of $f^{-1}(\base)$. 
By \cref{xca:component-connected}
the condition that \emph{each} $\ap{f}$ is injective
can be relaxed to $\ap{f}: (a_0=a_0)\to(f(a_0)=f(a_0))$ being injective.
Now look at the following subset:
\[
\set{~ l: \base = \base \mid {\ap{f}}^{-1}(plp^{-1})~ }.
\]
Clearly, a classification of connected \coverings over the circle
also classifies certain subsets of symmetries of $\base$.
Such subsets are closed under concatenation and inverses,
since $\ap{f}$ is compatible with these operations,
see \cref{lem:apcomp}.\footnote{%
Using language yet to be introduced, we actually classify the subgroups of the integers.}
We start by giving some examples of connected \coverings of the circle.
In the course of our discussion, we will see that -- assuming a weak form
of the Law of the Excluded Middle -- these are all the decidable connected 
\coverings over the circle.

\begin{example}\label{exa:univS1cover}
The \emph{universal} \covering from \cref{def:universalcover}
is the map $c_\base:\bn 1\to \Sc$ 
sending the unique element of $\bn 1$ to $\base$. 
(It takes this simple form since the circle is a pointed connected
groupoid, see the discussion before \cref{def:universalcover}.)
The universal \covering corresponds to the subset consisting 
of $\refl\base : \base=\base$ only.  
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{exa:mfoldS1cover}
For $m:\NN$ positive, define the \emph{degree $m$ function} by circle induction
\[
-^m:\Sc\to \Sc, \text{~~setting~} 
-^m(\base)\defeq\base \text{~~and~} 
-^m(\Sloop)\defis{\Sloop}^m.
\]
This \covering corresponds to the subset consisting 
of ${\Sloop}^{mn} : \base=\base$ for all $n:\zet$.
\end{example}

Note that the degree $0$ function would be constant,
and hence not a \covering since the domain is not a set,
see \cref{xca:constant-cover}

\begin{remark}
  \label{rem:RtoS1}
The universal \covering is essentially the same as defined in \cref{def:RtoS1}
and explained in \cref{rem:expforreal}
since the real numbers form a contractible space.

\label{rem:finitecoveringsofS1}
The analogue of our degree $m$ function is the $m$-th power of complex numbers 
restricted to the unit circle. % mapping $z$ to $z^m$ if $|z|=1$.  
The following visualization is perhaps more tangible.  
Let $m=12$ and picture the circle and mark $12$ evenly spaced points.
This will look like a clock, with marks $1,2,\dots,12$. 
You can then make a function from the circle to itself by sending 
all marks to $12$ and each of the arcs connecting the marks to the entire circle 
-- (in a continuous manner preserving the orientation).
  ((picture!!))
\end{remark}

We could be more ambitious and ask: what is the \emph{type} of decidable 
\coverings over the circle?  Since the type of \coverings is 
equivalent to $\Sc\to \Set$, and $\Set$ is a groupoid
(\cref{lem:Set-is-groupoid}),
\cref{lem:level-n-utils}(\ref{level-n-utils-codom}) gives
that the type of decidable \coverings over the circle is a groupoid.  
We will pin this groupoid down by first identifying the components 
(of which there turns out to be one for each natural number), 
and then analyzing one component at a time.

Recall the function $c:\Sc\to C$ of \cref{def:S1toC}. 
By \cref{thm:S1bysymmetries} we know that $c$ is an equivalence, 
so classifying \coverings over $\Sc$ is equivalent to 
classifying \coverings over $C$.  
We simplify the notation slightly, letting $\pt_C\defeq(\zet,\etop{s}):C$ 
(so that $\pt_C \jdeq c(\base)$ with $c$ from \cref{def:S1toC}), 
and allowing ourselves to write $s:\pt_C=_C\pt_C$ instead of the 
more honest $\pathpair{\etop{s}}{!}:\pt_C=_C\pt_C$ 
(equal to the $c$-image of ${\Sloop}:\base=\base$).

It is instructive to rephrase the examples of connected \coverings over $\Sc$ in 
terms of $C$, even though they could be transported along $\Sc=C$.

\begin{example}\label{exa:univCcover}
The universal \covering is represented by the constant function
$c_{(\zet,\etop{s})}:\bn 1\to C$ sending the unique element 
of $\bn 1$ to $(\zet,\etop{s}):C$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{exa:mfoldCcover}
Assume that $m:\NN$ is positive.  We give a description of 
the $m$-fold \covering over the circle in terms of $C$.
{\color{red} There are several interesting aspects. First,
for $\Sc$ we have $\base\jdeq-^m(\base)$ and for $C$, as we
will see, we get $(\zet,\etop{s}) = -^m(\zet,\etop{s})$, 
with $=$ and not with $\jdeq$.
Let's say $-^m(\zet,\etop{s})\jdeq(Y,\etop{r})$.
The loop of $(\zet,\etop{s})$ is based on $s$,
the corresponding loop of $(Y,\etop{r})$ is based on $r$.
The challenge is to arrange things in such a way that
$-^m$ acting on $s$ yields $r^m$.
This motivates the following definition.}

For any type $X$ and $f:X\to X$, we define the $m$-th \emph{root}
\[
{\sqrt[m]f} : {\bn m\times X} \to {\bn m\times X}
\]
of $f$ by setting 
\[
\sqrt[m]f(i,x)\defeq
\begin{cases}
  (i+1,x)& \text{for $i<m-1$ and}\\
  (0,f(x))& \text{for $i=m-1$}.
\end{cases}
\] 
Only one $m$-th of the time does $\sqrt[m]f$ use $f:X\to X$,
the rest of the time it increases the element in $\bn m$).
This is illustrated in \cref{fig:root} with the shift by $f$ being 
vertical and the movement along $\bn m$ going around a circle.

  \label{fig:root}
\end{figure}
Indeed, iterating $\sqrt[m]f$ we get $(\sqrt[m]f)^m(i,x)=(i,f(x))$; 
hence the term ``$m$-th root'' is apt.

If $f$ is an equivalence, then so is $\sqrt[m]f$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item on one hand $(\sqrt[m]f)(j,y)$ is equal to $(0,x)$ if and only 
if $j=m-1$ and $f(y)=x$, so  $(\sqrt[m]f)^{-1}(0,x)$ is equivalent 
to $f^{-1}(x)$ which is contractible if $f$ is an equivalence, and 
\item on the other, if $i:\bn m$ is not $0$, then $(\sqrt[m]f)(j,y)$ is equal 
to $(i,x)$ if and only $j+1=i$ and and $y=x$, 
and so  $(\sqrt[m]f)^{-1}(i,x)$ is equivalent to  a singleton.
OK FOR ANY *TYPE* X
\end{enumerate}

Using univalence, the $m$-th root construction applies not only to equivalences, 
but equally well to identities $f:X=X$, resulting in a function 
\[
-^m:\sum_{X:\UU}(X=X)\to\sum_{X:\UU}(X=X),\quad -^m(X,f)\defeq(\bn m\times X,\sqrt[m]f).
\]
We now focus on  $C$, the component of $\sum_{X:\UU}(X=X)$ containing $(\zet,\etop{s})$.
Note that the function $\mZ : (\bn m\times \zet) \to \zet$ 
given by $\mZ(i,n)=i+mn$ is an equivalence. 
Moreover we have ${\mZ\!\!\sqrt[m]s} = {s\mZ}$ since 
\[
\mZ(\sqrt[m]s(i,n)) = i+1+mn = s(\mZ(i,n))
~~\text{for all $(i,n):\bn m\times \zet$}.
\]  
Hence $ -^m(\zet,\etop{s}) \jdeq (\bn m\times\zet,\sqrt[m]{\etop{s}}) = (\zet,\etop{s})$. 
If $(\zet,\etop{s})=(X,f)$, then $-^m(\zet,\etop{s})=-^m(X,f)$, 
so $(\zet,\etop{s})=-^m(X,f)$. Hence we can actually restrict the
\emph{degree $m$ function} to the component $C$\footnote{\color{red}%
Note to BID: what about this phrasing, not mentioning truncation?}
: 
\[
-^m:C\to C,\qquad -^m(X,f)\defeq(\bn m\times X,\sqrt[m]f).%,~~\text{for all $(X,f):C$}.
\]
All reincarnations of the degree $m$ function are denoted the same.

% In consequence, if $(X,f):C$ (\ie $(X,f):\sum_{X:\Set}X=_\UU X$ is in the component of $(\zet,s)$) then also $(\sqrt[m]X,\sqrt[m]f):C$, giving rise to the 
%
% , where $$\sqrt[m]X=\bn m\times X$$ and $\sqrt[m]f(i,x)=(i+1,x)$ for $i<m-1$ and $\sqrt[m]f(m-1,x)=(1,f(x))$.  We prove that $-^m((X,f))$ is in the component of $(\zet,s)$ (which was a requirement for elements in $C$).
 % Since we know that $(X,f)$ is in the component of $(\zet,s)$ it is enough consider the element $(p,!):(\sqrt[m]{\zet},\sqrt[m]s)=(zet,s)$ explicitly given by univalence through $p((i,n))=i+mn$ ((check that it gives an equivalence)).

We now analyze how $-^m$ acts on paths. Let $(\etop{p},!):(X,f)=_C(X',f')$.
Since $-^m$ maps first components $X$ to $\bn m\times X$, we get that
the first projection of $\ap{-^m}(\etop{p},!)$ is 
$\overline{\id\times p} : (\bn m\times X) = (\bn m\times X')$.
We are particularly interested in the case of the loop of $C$, 
that is, $(\etop{s},!):(\zet,\etop{s})=_C(\zet,\etop{s})$.
We calculate $(\id\times s)(i,n) = (i,s(n))$,
which by the property of the $m$-root is equal to $(\sqrt[m]s)^m(i,n)$.
So we have $(\id\times s)=(\sqrt[m]s)^m$, which means that
$\ap{-^m}(\etop{s},!)$ is indeed the $m$-power of the
loop of $(\bn m\times \zet,\sqrt[m]{\etop{s}})$.

%$$(\id\times p,!):(\bn m\times X,\sqrt[m]f)=(\bn m\times X',\sqrt[m]f')$$
\footnote{\color{red}%
Fact $!:(\id\times p)\sqrt[m]f=_{\bn m\times X=\bn m\times X'}\sqrt[m]{f'}(\id\times p)$
since $(i,x)$ is taken to $(i+1,px)$ if $i<m-1$, and $(m-1,x)$ is taken to $(0,f'px)$
and $(0,pfx)$, respectively, which are equal by assumption NOT USED, THIS HOLDS
BY THE ACTION ON PATHS} 


This will eventually ((forwardref)) be explained in terms of the symmetries of the 
degree $m$ \covering of the circle being given by the powers of $\sqrt[m]s$ in a 
nonunique fashion: for any $a:\zet$, the $a$-th and the $(a+m)$-th power of 
$\sqrt[m]s$ give rise to the same symmetry.

Why does this correspond to the $m$-fold \covering we defined in \cref{exa:mfoldS1cover}?  
This is encapsuled by the fact that under the equivalence $c:\Sc\to C$ the two $m$-fold covers agree in the sense that the two functions given as composites in
$$\xymatrix{\Sc\ar[r]^c\ar[d]^{-^m}&C\ar[d]^{-^m}\\\Sc\ar[r]^c&C}$$ are equal.  One composite is given by $-^mc(\base)=(\zet,s)$ and $-^mc(\Sloop)=s^m$ and the other is given by $c-^m(\base)=(\bn m\times\zet,\sqrt[m]s)$ and $c-^m(\Sloop)=\id\times s$ 
({\color{red} interchanged?})
and the proof that these two functions are equal is given by the (identity corresponding by univalence to the) equivalence  $\mZ: (\bn m\times \zet)\to\zet$ with $\mZ(i,n)=i+mn$ discussed above, since transport of $\sqrt[m]s$ along $\mZ$ is exactly $s^m$ (\ie, $\mZ\cdot\sqrt[m]s=s^m\cdot\mZ$,
({\color{red} I think $s^m$ should twice be $s$, and that the cicle induction requires that $\mZ$ is invariant under $\Sloop$, see kladdeark when we talk})
note the way we formulate this so that we don't need to talk about an inverse of $\mZ$).
\end{example}

\begin{xca}
Check the implicit claims in \cref{exa:mfoldCcover}.  ((perhaps best to make them explicit?))
\end{xca}

There are many instances of the $m$-th root construction which is of independent interest.  
We record the following for future reference.
\begin{definition} \label{def:Zetmodm}
Let $m$ be a positive integer.
The element $\zet/m:\sum_{X:\Set}(X=X)$ has first projection $\bn m\times\bn 1$ and 
second projection $\sqrt[m]{\id}$.
\end{definition}
This realizes the cycle $0\mapsto1\mapsto\dots\mapsto m-1\mapsto 0$ in $\bn m$, and so models ``modular arithmetic''.


Any (other) textbook will tell you that these are all the connected \coverings over the circle (precisely one for each natural number), but the procedure is unfortunately not constructive: we need a further assumption which is not generally present in our setup, namely

\begin{quote}
  {\bf The Limited Principle of Omniscience} (LPO)\index{LPO}\label{LPO}\footnote{make an environment that principles can fit in and be numbered} If given a function $P:\NN\to\bn 2$, then either $P$ is constant (we have that $\prod_{n:\NN}(P(0)=P(n))$) or there is an $n_0:\NN$ such that $P(n_0)\neq P(0)$.
\end{quote}
LPO is weaker than the law of excluded middle and we are free to assume it as an axiom -- or not.  We will be explicit about where we will use it.


Fix for the moment a connected type $A$ and a decidable \covering 
$$f:A\to C$$ (c.f \cref{def:covering}) and an element $\pt_A:f^{-1}(\pt_C)$.  %Assume $(\pt_A,!):f^{-1}(\pt_C)$
%Recall the element 
%$$\pt_C\defequi(s,\refl{ss}):(\zet,s)=_C(\zet,s),$$ which by \cref{def:S1toC} corresponds to $\Sloop:\base=\base$.
By \cref{lem:eqandcovofconntypes}, the fact that $f$ is a decidable \covering exactly says that the induced function of identity types
$$g\defequi\ev_0f^=:(\pt_A=_A\pt_A)\to (\pt_C=_C\pt_C)=\zet$$ is 
injective and (the fibers are) decidable.\footnote{say this in a way consistent with the choices of subsets/injections/embeddings}    

Assume LPO.  We are then left with two situations (use that $g$ is injective and decidable): either $\pt_A=_A\pt_A$ is contractible or there is a $p_0:\pt_A=_A\pt_A$ with $g(p_0)$ different from $0$. 

In the former case ($\pt_A=\pt_A$ is contractible), \cref{lem:eqandcovofconntypes} together with the fact that $A$ is connected implies that $A$ itself is contractible.  

On the other hand, if $p_0:\pt_A=\pt_A$ with $g(p_0)$ different from $0$, then either $g(p_0)$ or $g(p_0^{-1})$ is a positive integer.  Hence the set $H^+$ of positive integers in the image of $g$ is nonempty, and so the fact \cref{def:Nwellordered} that $\NN$ is well ordered implies that $H^+$ has a minimum, \ie there is a $p:\pt_A=\pt_A$ with  $g(p)=m\defequi\min H^+:H^+$.  Furthermore, if $q:\pt_A=\pt_A$ is any element with $0<g(q)$, then  by Euclidean division of \cref{lem:euclid-div}, there exist $k,r:\NN$ with $r<m$ so that $g(q)=km+r$.  Now, the natural number $r$ is in the image of $g$ (because $r=g(q)-km=g(qp^{-k})$) and is less than the minimal positive value $m=g(p)$, and so we must conclude that $r=0$, or in other words, $g(q)$ is a multiple $g(p)k$ of the minimal positive value $g(p)$.

% \cref{cor:arch} there is a $k:\NN$ such that $g(p)k\leq g(q)<g(p)(k+1)$, or equivalently $0\leq g(q)-g(p)k< g(p)$.  Since $g(q)-g(p)k=g(qp^{-k})$ is a nonnegative integer is in the image of $g$ and simultaneously less than the minimum positive value $g(p)$, we must conclude that $g(q)=g(p)k$.\footnote{rewrite/simplify given that Euclid is now in intro}

Arguing similarly for the negative values, we reach the conclusion that the image of $g$ in $\zet$ is the subset of multiples of $g(p)=\min H^+$.  Hence, the image of $f^=:(\pt_A=\pt_A)\to(\base=_{\Sc}\base)$ is uniquely given by the positive integer $\min H^+$, and is not dependent on $\pt_A$.\footnote{how to say this gently without starting to much fuss regarding commutativity?}  Furthermore, if $p_A:A=_{\UU}A'$, $f':A'\to B$ and $p_f:f'p_A=_{A\to B}f$, then tracing through the argument, we see that the positive number reached through arguing with $f':A'\to B$ remains the same, but there \emph{is} a possibility that $g(p_0)$ changes sign, so that the minimum of $H^+$ is now not attained by $g(p_0)$, but by $g(p_0^{-1})$.\footnote{maybe some HoTT guy can say this less classically.  We also want to say something about the connection to pointed \coverings, conjugations etc to clear the path for later applications}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:componentsofcoversofS1}
  % Assume the LPO. Given a connected decidable \covering of the circle,  there is a unique natural number $m$ so that the connected \covering is equal to the connected \covering $-^m$ of \cref{exa:listofS1covers}.  This gives an equivalence between $\NN$ and the propositional truncation of the type of connected decidable \covering of the circle.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The type of decidable \coverings over the circle by connected types is a groupoid.
  \item Assuming, the LPO the type of decidable \coverings over the circle by connected types is the sum of the component containing the universal \covering and for each positive integer $m$, the component containing the $m$-fold \covering.
  \end{enumerate}

\end{lemma}

\nocite{contructive-algebra}
% A natural question is, given $m:\NN$, what does the associated connective \covering $f:A\to \Sc$ look like?

% We saw that if $m=0$, then the identity types of $A$ were contractible, and so (in view of \cref{lem:eqandcovofconntypes} since $A$ is connected) $A$ is itself contractible.

\begin{remark}
  \label{rem:flipthecircle}
  The reader may wonder how the ``orientation reversing'' $c:\Sc\to \Sc$ given by $c(\base)=\base$ and $c(\Sloop)=\Sloop^{-1}$ fits into the picture.  In our setting it is equal to the identity on $\Sc$ (corresponding to $m=1$): Letting also $c:\Sc=\Sc$ be the identity given by univalence, we have that $\refl{\Sc}=c\cdot c$, so that $c$ itself proves that $\id_{\Sc}$ and $c$ are equal.
\end{remark}

\section{Symmetries of \coverings of the circle are ``cyclic'' }
\label{sec:deckS1}

% In this section we prove the following result.  
The term ``cyclic'' in the chapter heading refers to the fact that we show that the symmetries of \coverings are determined by iterations of a single symmetry.  



\begin{remark}
Since we are interested in the symmetries of particular \coverings it is good to spell out some details.
By \cref{lem:isEq-pair=} (DAN WILL CHECK THIS) the identity type  
$(A,f,!)=(A',f',!)$ of two \coverings over the type $B$ is equivalent to 
\[
\sum_{p_A:A=_{\UU}A'}(f'p_A=_{A\to B}f). 
\]
$$\xymatrix{A\ar@{=}[rr]^{p_A}_\to\ar[dr]_f&&A\ar[dl]^{f'}\\&\,B.&}$$
Here and below, the $p_A$ in the equation $f'p_A=_{A\to B}f$ is 
shorthand for the canonical equivalence from $A$ to $A'$ 
coming from the identification $p_A:A=_{\UU}A'$ by first
applying $\cast:(A=A')\to (A\equiv A')$, and then
applying $\fst:(A\equiv A')\to(A\to A')$ to the result,
in total $\fst(\cast(p_A)): A\to A'$.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:coveringsofS1}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item 
  The set $c_\base=c_\base$ of symmetries of the universal \covering of the circle is equivalent to $\zet$.  
Furthermore, there is a symmetry $$Q^1:c_\base=c_\base$$ so that, considered as an element in $\sum_{X:\Set}X=X$ the pair $(c_\base=c_\base,Q^1)$ is equal to $(\zet,s)$.  

The component of the type of \coverings over the circle containing the universal \covering is equivalent to the circle via the map from $S^1$ sending $\base$ to $c_\base$ and $\Sloop$ to $Q^1$.
\item For a positive integer $m$, the set $-^m=-^m$ of symmetries of the $m$-fold \covering of the circle is equivalent to $\bn m$.  

Furthermore, there is a symmetry $$Q^1:-^m=-^m$$ so that considered as an element in $\sum_{X:\Set}X=X$ the pair $(-^m=-^m,Q^1)$ is equal to $\zet/m$ of \cref{def:Zetmodm}.

The component of the type of \coverings over the circle containing the $m$-fold covering is equivalent to $$\sum_{X:\Set}\sum_{p:X=X}||(X,p)=\zet/m||.$$
  \end{enumerate}

 \end{theorem}
\begin{remark}\label{rem:thenonuniquenessofgeneratorsofmodulararithmetic1}
  The symmetries called $Q^1$ in \cref{thm:coveringsofS1} are not uniquely determined by the stated property.  
In the case of the universal \covering there are two candidates and for the $m$-fold \covering there are as many as there are positive integers less than $m$ that does not divide $m$.  
This behavior has number theoretic consequences and origins and will be investigated further when we have the proper machinery to put it to good use.
\end{remark}

  \begin{proof}
  ((spell out $Q^1$))
We are going to investigate the set 
$$D_0\defequi\sum_{g:\bn 1=\bn 1}c_\bullet g=c_\bullet$$ 
of symmetries of the universal \covering $c_\bullet$ of the circle.  
Our preferred interpretation of $c_\bullet:\bn 1\to C$ is as the first projection from $P\defequi\sum_{(Y,g):C}(\zet,s)=(Y,g)$ to $C$, and the equivalence $c_{((\zet,s),\refl{})}:\bn 1\to P$. % sends the unique point in $\bn 1$ to $(\zet,s):C$ and $\refl{}:(\zet,s)=(\zet,s)$. 
More generally, for any type $A$ the function $A\to(\bn 1\to A)$ sending $a:A$ to the function $c_a$ sending the unique element in $\bn 1$ to $a$ is an equivalence, and if $A$ is contractible, then every $c_a$ is an equivalence.

   Consequently, $D_0$ is equivalent to
$$\sum_{((Y,g),p):P}(\zet,s)=_C(Y,g)$$ 
which can be rewritten as
$$\sum_{(Y,g):C}((\zet,s)=_C(Y,g))\times((\zet,s)=_C(Y,g))
$$
For any $a,b:A$ the ``shear'' 
$$\mathrm{shear}:((a=_Ab)\times(a=_Ab))\to((a=_Ab)\times(a=_Aa))$$ 
given by $\mathrm{shear}(p,q)\defequi(p,q^{-1}p)$
is an equivalence and
% The function in 
% $((\zet,s)=_C(Y,g))\times(((\zet,s)=_C(Y,g))\to (((\zet,s)=_C(Y,g)\times(\zet,s)=_C(\zet,s))$ sending $(p,q)$ to $(p,q^{-1}p)$ is an equivalence,
so $D_0$ is equivalent to 
$$\sum_{(Y,g):C}((\zet,s)=_C(Y,g))\times ((\zet,s)=_C(\zet,s)).
$$
Using the equivalence $\ev_0:((\zet,s)=_C(\zet,s))\equiv\zet$ of \cref{lem:IdCisZet}, this
 reduces to 
$$D_0\simeq P\times\zet\simeq\zet.$$
    
((this does most of what is needed for the $m$-fold \covering.  Needs to be proofread))
    Let $m$ be a positive integer.  
Recall the $m$-fold \covering, either in the guise $-^m:\Sc\to \Sc$ of \cref{exa:mfoldS1cover} or $-^m:C\to C$ of \cref{exa:mfoldCcover}.
We are going to investigate the set
$$D_m\defequi\sum_{g:\Sc=\Sc}-^mg=_{\Sc\to \Sc}-^m$$  
%$$D_m\defequi\sum_{g:C=C}-^mg=_{C\to C}-^m$$ 
of symmetries of the $m$-fold \covering of the circle% , or equivalently, by univalence, $\sum_{t:C\simeq C}-^mt=_{C\to C}-^m$
.  
By univalence and thanks to the equivalence $c:\Sc\to C$ of \cref{thm:S1bysymmetries} $(\Sc= \Sc)$ is equivalent to $(\Sc\simeq C)$.
Since being contractible is a proposition, $\Sc\simeq C$ is a subtype of $\Sc\to C$,
% Thanks to the equivalence $c:\Sc\to C$ of \cref{thm:S1bysymmetries} $(C\to C)$ is equivalent to $(\Sc\to C)$,
which by \cref{lem:freeloopspace} is ultimately equivalent to $\sum_{(Y,g,!):C}(Y,g,!)=(Y,g,!)$. 
For the moment we'll investigate the simpler type 
$$F_m\defequi\sum_{t:\Sc\to C}-^mt=_{\Sc\to C}-^mc$$
and on the way discover that if $(t,Q):F_m$, then $t$ is an equivalence, so that $F_m$ actually {\bf is} equivalent to the type $D_m$ we are interested in.

Given If $t:\Sc\to C$ is given by $t(\base)\defequi (Y,g,!)$ (where $!$ asserts that $(Y,g)$ lies in the component of $(\zet,s)$)  and $t(\Sloop)=(p,!,!):(Y,g,!)=_C(Y,g,!)$, (where $p:Y=Y$ and $pg=gp$ (an identity in the set $Y=Y$)), we study the type $-^mt=_{\Sc\to C}-^mc$.
Spelling out the details we see that $-^mc$ is defined by 
$$-^mc(\base)=(\bn m\times\zet,\sqrt[m]s,!)$$ and 
$$-^mc(\Sloop)\defequi(\id\times s,!,!):(\bn m\times\zet,\sqrt[m]s,!)=_C(\bn m\times\zet,\sqrt[m]s,!)$$   and $-^mt$ is given by $$-^mt(\base)\oldequiv(\bn m\times Y,\sqrt[m]g,!)$$ and 
$$-^mt(\Sloop)\oldequiv(\id\times p,!,!):(\bn m\times Y,\sqrt[m]g,!)=_C(\bn m\times Y,\sqrt[m]g,!).$$

An element in $Q:-^mc=-^mt$ is then given by a 
$$q:\bn m\times\zet=\bn m\times Y$$ so that $\sqrt[m]g\ q=q\sqrt[m]s$ and $q(\id\times s)=(\id\times p)q$ (both in $\bn m\times\zet=\bn m\times Y$). 
Now, the element $$q^{-1}(\id\times s)q=q^{-1}(\sqrt[m]s)^mq=(q^{-1}\sqrt[m]sq)^m$$ in $\bn m\times Y=\bn m\times Y$ is both equal to $\id\times p$ and equal to $(\sqrt[m]g)^m=\id\times g$, proving that $p=g$. 


Consider another element $(t',Q'):F_m$ (as for $(t,Q)$, we spell out $(t',Q')$ in terms of its accompanying $Y'$, $g'$ and $q'$). 
An identity  $R:(t,Q)=_{F_m}(t',Q')$ consists of a $\rho:t=t'$ and an $s:(-^m\rho)Q=_{-^mc=-^mt'}Q'$ (note that this is a proposition), \ie $R$ is given by an $r:Y=Y'$ with 
$$g'r=_{Y=Y'}rg\text{ and }(\id\times r)q=_{\bn m\times Y=\bn m\times Y'}q'(\id\times r).$$  This shows that every $(t,Q):F_m$ is equal to one with $(Y,g)$ being $(\zet,s)$ and $p$ being $s$, and we \emph{could} reduce to this case, leaving to $q$ the entire burden of proof.  
This also shows another thing: the $t:\Sc\to C$ fitting in pairs $(t,Q):F_m$ are all equivalences, so that $F_m$ actually is equivalent to the type $\sum_{g:C=C}-^mg=_{C\to C}-^m$ we are trying to understand.

 On the level of equivalences $\zet\simeq Y$, the equation  $\sqrt[m]g\ q=q\sqrt[m]s$ claims that providing $q$ is the same as providing a point $q(0,0):Y$ through the equation  
$$q(i,n)=q((\sqrt[m]s)^{i+nm}(0,0))=(\sqrt[m]g)^{i+nm}q(0,0).$$  For $(i,k)\in \bn m\times\zet$ define $Q^{(i,k)}$ by setting its first projection to be $q^{(i,k)}=(\sqrt[m]g)^{i+km}q$.  
This exhausts all possible $q(0,0):Y$, so we have accounted for all possible $Q$s.

However, there is some redundancy: since $(\sqrt[m]g)^{i+km}=(\sqrt[m]g)^i(\id\times g^k)$, we have that $g^k:Y=Y$ proves that $Q^{i+km}=Q^{i}$.  ((explain why there is no more redundancy)) 

In hindsight we can give concrete descriptions of all the symmetries: for $i=0,\dots m-1$, let $(Y,g)\defequi (\zet,s)$, $p\defequi s$, and $q(0,0)\defequi i$.

With respect to the identification of the component of the $m$-fold covering.  The type of coverings of the circle is equivalent to $\sum_{X:\Set}X=X$ and by the above, the \covering being in the component of the $m$-fold cover corresponds to $(X,p)$ being in the component of $\zet/m$.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{remark}
    Regarding the symmetries of the $m$-fold \covering of the circle, recall the picture we tried to evoke in \cref{rem:finitecoveringsofS1}.  How can I move my circle with $m$ evenly spaced marked points  (which we now call $0,1,\dots, m-1$ instead of $1,2,\dots 12$ since it fits better with future applications) without disturbing the projection down to the circle (sending all the marked points to $0$).  I can move the marked points, but a marked point has to be sent to a marked point (otherwise the projection down to the circle would be disturbed).  Let's say that mark $0$ is sent to mark $4$.  However, since we have to preserve the projection down to the circle, the arc from $0$ to $1$ must then be sent to the arc from $4$ to $5$.  Continuing in this fashion, we see that we describe a certain rotation of the circle.  Varying $4$ between $0$ and $m-1$ we see that there are exactly $m$ different symmetries of the $m$-fold \covering.  Furthemore they are all rotations of the circle by an angle which is a multiple of $2\pi/m$.

\subsection{Request wrt notation}
\label{sec:requestnotation}

If $f:A\to B$ and $(a,p):f^{-1}(b)$ (for $a:A$, $b:B$ and $p:f(a)=b$), then the function
$$\mathrm{ad}_p\ap f:(a=a)\to(b=b)$$

I have occasionally sinned and called it $f^=$ (with $p$ implicit).  
I am now converging to using ``$f^p$'' (superscript since I have needed it in situations with other subscripts).

 $$(x_0,\refl{y_0})=_{f^{-1}(y_0)}(x_1,q).$$ 
If in addition $X$ and $Y$ are connected, then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is an equivalence if and only $\ap f%f^=_{x_0,x_1}
$ is an equivalence and
\item $f$ is a \covering if and only if  $\ap f%^=_{x_0,x_1}
$ is an injection (\ie if and only if all the preimages of $\ap f$ are propositions).
\end{enumerate}

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
((proofread))
  Recall the family $\uc{x_0} : X\to\UU$, $\uc{x_0}(x)\defequi (x=x_0)$, giving rise to the contractible type $\uc{x_0}X=\sum_{x:X}(x_0=x)$.  The function $f$ induces a function of types 
$$\uc{f}:\sum_{x:X}(x_0=x)\to\sum_{y:Y}(y_0=y),\qquad \uc{f}(x,p)=(f(x),\ap f p).$$  Since $\uc{f}$ is a function between contractible types it must be an equivalence.  Hence, the preimage of $(y_0,\refl{y_0})$, 
$$(\uc{f})^{-1}(y_0,\refl{y_0})\oldequiv\sum_{x:X}\sum_{p:x_0=x}\sum_{r:y_0=f(x)}r=\ap f(p),$$  
is contractible.  
Consider the projection 
$$(\uc{f})^{-1}(y_0,\refl{y_0})\to f^{-1}(y_0)$$ and observe that the preimage over $(x_1,q:y_0=y_1) $ is equivalent to the preimage $(\ap f)^{-1}(q)\defequi\sum_{p:x_0=x_1}q=\ap f(p)$.  Spelling out the last equivalence: the preimage of $(x_1,q:y_0=y_1) $ spelled out in full is
$$\sum_{x:X}\sum_{p:x_0=x}\sum_{r:y_0=f(x)}r=\ap f(p)\times(\sum_{a:x_1=x}\ap f q=r),$$
which is equivalent to the reshuffle
$$\sum_{p':x_0=x}\sum_{s:q=\ap f p'}\left(\sum_{x:X}(x_0=x)\times\sum_{t:y_0=f(x_1)}(q=s)\right)$$
via the function sending $(x,p,r,u,v)$ to $(a^{-1}p,\ap f a^{-1}\,vu,x,p,\ap f a^{-1}\, r,v)$. ((check))  Now, in the last everything in the parenthesis is contractible, and what is left is exactly $(\ap f)^{-1}(q)$.  Since $(\uc{f})^{-1}(y_0,\refl{y_0})$ is contractible, this shows that $(\ap f)^{-1}(q)$ is equivalent to $(x_0,\refl{y_0})=_{f^{-1}(y_0)}(x_1,q).$

Now, assume that $X$ and $Y$ are connected.   If $f$ is an equivalence, it follows automatically that the function of identity types is, so we concentrate on the other implication and assume the induced function from $x_0=x_0$ to $f(x_0)=f(x_0)$ is an equivalence.  We want to show that all fibers of $f$ are contractible, but since $Y$ is connected it is enough to consider the fiber $f^{-1}(y_0)\defequi\sum_{x:X}y_0=f(x)$ over $y_0\defequi f(x_0)$.  Now, $(x_0,\refl{y_0})=_{f^{-1}(y_0)}(x_1,q)$ are the fiber of a function from a contractible type to $f^{-1}(y_0)$, so $f^{-1}(y_0)$ is contractible if all the $(x_0,\refl{y_0})=_{f^{-1}(y_0)}(x_1,q)$'s are contractible, which by the previous result is equivalent to $\ap f$ being an equivalence.  

The statement about \coverings is the similar, except that now one desires that the identity types $(x_0,\refl{y_0})=_{f^{-1}(y_0)}(x_1,q)$ should be propositions (for $f^{-1}(y_0)$ to be a set, which then is equivalent to the preimages $(\ap f)^{-1}(q)$ being propositions.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:eqofconntypes}\footnote{
%The argument for a general group and the torsors over its abstract group is VERY similar.  
Essentially it is our version of ``a group homomorphism is an isomorphism iff it is a bijection'': proofread}
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be connected types, $x_0:X$ and let $f:X\to Y$ be a function.  Then $f$ is an equivalence if and only if the induced function from $x_0=x_0$ to $f(x_0)=f(x_0)$ is.\footnote{note to self: try to be consistent in writing equalities with right variance (as I hope I have managed to do here)}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  

 Its fiber over $(y_0,\refl{y_0})$ is 
$$(\uc{f})^{-1}(y_0,\refl{y_0})\oldequiv\sum_{x:X}\sum_{p:x_0=x}\sum_{q:y_0=f(x)}q=f(p),$$ and is contractible since it is the fiber of a function of contractible types.  
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be connected types, $x_0:X$ and let $f:X\to Y$ be a function.  Then $f$ is a \covering if and only if the induced function from $x_0=x_0$ to $f(x_0)=f(x_0)$ is an injection.\footnote{embedding/injection...}

% \subsubsection{Equivalences}
% \label{sec:equivalences}
% Two types are equivalent if you can freely translate back and forth between them: 
% \begin{definition}
%   Let $A$ and $B$ be types.  The type of \emph{equivalences} from $A$ to $B$ is
% $$\Eq(A,B)\defequi\sum_{f: A\to B}\left(\sum_{g:B\to A}\prod_{a:A}g(f(a))=a\right)\times\left(\sum_{h:B\to A}\prod_{b:B}f(h(b))=b\right).
% $$
% \end{definition}
% \begin{remark}
%   You recognize the spirit of ``inverse function'' in the definition of equivalences: an equivalence is a function $f:A\to B$ which has a $g:B\to A$ so that for all $a:A$ we have $g(f(a))=a$ and also an $h:B\to A$ so that for all $b:B$ we have that $f(h(b))=b$.  We will see in Lemma~\ref{lem:leftinvisrightinv} that this forces $g$ and $h$ to be equal, but it is technically convenient not to insist on this in the definition itself.  We refer to $g$ as a \emph{left inverse} of $f$ and $h$ as a \emph{right inverse} of $f$.
% \end{remark}


% \begin{lemma}
%   Given $f : A\to B$, the type of left inverses of $f$, 
% $$\sum_{g:B\to A}\prod_{a:A}g(f(a))=a,$$ is a proposition.  Consequently, the projection $\Eq(A,B)\to (A\to B)$ is a monomorphism.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
%   ((write)) 4.2.9
% \end{proof}
% \begin{remark}
%   In view of this result, we will say that $f:A\to B$ \emph{is an equivalence from $A$ to $B$} if it is the projection of an equivalence from $A$ to $B$.  Occasionally the following alternative notation is more convenient:
% $$(A\simeq B)\defequi\Eq(A,B),$$
% and ocasionally we'll be sloppy and write $f:A\simeq B$ instead of the actual tuple $(f,(g,p),(h,q))$, hiding the (unique) choice proving that we actually are talking about an equivalence. 
% \end{remark}

% \begin{lemma}\label{lem:leftinvisrightinv}
%   The left and right inverses of an equivalence are equal.\footnote{check compatibility of notation and agree whether the carefree language is ok}
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
%   Let $(f,(g,p),(h,q)):\Eq(A,B)$. Then, for all $b:B$ we have $g(q_b):g(f(h(b))=g(b)$,  and $p_{h(b)}:g(f(h(b)))=h(b)$, and so, using symmetry and transitivity of the identity type, we have that $g(b)=h(b)$. 
% \end{proof}
% \begin{example}
%   If $A$ is a type, then the identity function $\id_A:A\to A$ (given by $\id_A(a)=a$) is an equivalence: it is its own (left and right) inverse, with $\refl a:\id_A(\id_A(a))=a$ as witness(es).  
% \end{example}


% \begin{remark}
%   Inspired by sets, one can think of another possible definition of equivalence: namely a function $f:A\to B$ is a bijection if it is one-to-one and onto.  Spelling this out in detail, it means that for evey $b:B$ there is \emph{exactly one} $a:A$ such that $f(a)=b$.  The inverse of $f$ is then constructed by sending $b:B$ to the unique $a:A$ with $f(a)=b$.  The set of $a:A$ with $f(a)=b$ is called the ``preimage'' or ``fiber'' $f^{-1}(b)$ over $b$, and the condition then reads that ``for every $b:B$ the fiber over $b$ contains exactly one element''.  This works in our setting as well.  
% \end{remark}
% We must first transcribe these notions to our setting.
% \begin{definition}
%   The \emph{fiber} of a function $f:A\to B$ and $b:B$ over an element $b:B$ is the type
% $$f^{-1}(b)=\sum_{a:A}f(a)=b.$$
% The type of \emph{contractions} of a type $A$ is
% $$\iscontr(A)\defequi\sum_{a:A}\prod_{x:A}a=x.$$
% \end{definition}
% Note that an element in $\iscontr(A)$ consists of a point $a:A$ and for every $x:A$ a $p_x:a=x$, that is, a proof of the assertion that all elements of $A$ are equal to $a$.  

% If $f:A\to B$ is a function of types, we say that $f$ i a \emph{weak equivalence} if for every $b:B$ there is an $a:A$ such that for all $x:A$ with $f(x)=b$ we have a $p_x:a=x$.  More precisely:


% \begin{definition}
%   If $A$ and $B$ are types, the type of \emph{weak equivalences} from $A$ to $B$ is
% $$\wEq(A,B)=\sum_{f:A\to B}\prod_{b:B}\sum_{a:A}\prod_{x:A}
% $$
% \end{definition}
