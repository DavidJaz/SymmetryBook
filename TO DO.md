We'll start working on this bit:

1. Introduction [motivating examples]
   - Mathematical objects; no entity without identi(ty/fications)
   - Geometry and algebra united via symmetry (Erlangen Program)
   - Impossibility results: ruler+compass, root extraction
2. Mathematical objects and constructions
   - types, Σ, Π, =, U, ℕ, Fin, ×, →
   - constructions, pair, λ, idp, 0, successor, etc.
   - equivalences, h-levels, truncation, propositions, sets
   - logic, ∧, ∨, ∃, ∀, →
3. Groups
   - structure of identity types
   - automorphism 1-group = fundamental group (hint at higher groups)
   - homomorphisms induced by functions (early)
   - more examples: symmetric groups, integers, cyclic groups & modular arithmetic
   - group actions, orbits and fixed points
   - subgroups
   - Cayley's theorem
